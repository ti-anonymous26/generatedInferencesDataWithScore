Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Confirming which flow anomalies are true leaks,Flow anomalies that are consistently followed by leak detections in the same time window and zone are true leak-related anomalies.,4,"Event-specific correlation with zone and timing; strong reconstruction potential."
Flow anomalies that are just heavy usage,"Flow anomalies that almost never coincide with any leak detections represent legitimate high-usage patterns, not leaks.",2,"Characterizes benign usage patterns; limited privacy beyond occupancy timing."
Flow-based early warning pattern for leaks,Repeated small flow anomalies that regularly occur before a leak is later recorded indicate a predictive stress signature for emerging leaks.,3,"Precursor patterns per zone/time; moderate sensitivity."
Estimating leak size from anomaly magnitude,"For leak events with associated flow anomalies, the integrated magnitude (height × duration) of the anomaly correlates with leak severity or volume.",4,"Quantifies event severity and timing; supports detailed incident reconstruction."
Distinguishing main-line failures from local branch leaks,"A single large flow anomaly followed by multiple leak detections across different locations suggests a main supply-line failure, while smaller anomalies with single leaks suggest local branch leaks.",4,"Reveals network topology and multi-zone impact; location-sensitive."
Chronic slow leaks vs. acute bursts,"Long, low-level flow anomalies that occasionally trigger small leak events indicate chronic slow leaks, while short, high spikes with immediate leak detections indicate acute bursts.",3,"Classifies leak type and timing; moderate incident specificity."
Identifying hidden leaks where leak sensors miss events,Locations with frequent flow anomalies but very few or no leak detections likely have leaks that are not being captured by leak sensors.,4,"Highlights unsensed leaks tied to specific zones; notable location exposure."
Evaluating leak sensor reliability,"If most significant flow anomalies lead to leak detections but some zones show anomalies with no leaks recorded, the leak sensors in those zones may be faulty or misconfigured.",2,"Sensor reliability check per zone; low personal/behavior detail."
Tuning flow anomaly thresholds using leak outcomes,Comparing flow anomaly sizes that did result in leak detections with those that did not helps tune thresholds to better separate harmful from harmless flow events.,2,"Policy/threshold tuning using aggregated outcomes; minimal privacy risk."
Differentiating fixture misuse from leaks,"Short-lived flow anomalies during high-occupancy periods that seldom produce leak records indicate usage spikes, whereas similar anomalies during low-occupancy periods that correlate with leaks signal actual failures.",3,"Links anomalies to occupancy timing vs. failure; moderate behavior exposure."
Cascading failures after a major anomaly,A very large flow anomaly followed by multiple leak detections over a short period suggests that one major hydraulic event caused secondary leaks.,4,"Cascade timeline across zones; high reconstruction and location sensitivity."
Impact of shutoff timing on leak duration,The gap between the end of a flow anomaly and the last leak detection shows how quickly damaging flow was stopped after being detected.,4,"Incident-specific mitigation timing; reveals response effectiveness."
Flow anomaly shape as a signature for specific leak types,Distinct flow anomaly shapes that consistently correspond to particular leak patterns can be used as signatures for different failure modes.,2,"Pattern library for classification; low direct privacy impact."
Temporal ordering of flow anomaly and leak detection,"If leak detections usually lag behind flow anomalies, certain anomaly patterns can be treated as pre-leak warnings and trigger earlier alerts.",3,"Sequence-based warnings; moderate incident detail."
Identifying multi-source leaks from one anomaly,A single continuous flow anomaly followed by multiple leak detections in different nearby zones indicates multiple leak points sharing the same upstream failure.,4,"Multi-zone spread tied to one event; high location/layout exposure."
Branch vulnerability scoring,Branches that show both frequent flow anomalies and frequent leak detections can be scored as high-risk segments of the plumbing network.,3,"Branch-level risk map; location-specific but aggregated over time."
Recognizing benign baseline anomalies,Flow anomalies that repeatedly occur at similar times and magnitudes but never align with leak detections form a pattern of benign baseline anomalies.,2,"Labels harmless patterns; limited privacy beyond routine timing."
Discovering pre-failure stress periods,Leak clusters that occur after earlier short flow anomalies in the same general window suggest the system experienced stress periods before actually failing.,3,"Identifies stressed windows with timelines; moderate sensitivity."
Evaluating effectiveness of pressure or flow control upgrades,"Before and after upgrades, comparing the number and magnitude of flow anomalies and the frequency of associated leaks indicates whether control improvements were effective.",2,"Pre/post comparison; aggregated, low personal exposure."
Confirming anomaly-driven vs. spontaneous leaks,Leaks that regularly occur without any preceding flow anomaly are likely driven by material or structural issues rather than flow-induced stress.,3,"Classifies cause of incidents; moderate event specificity."
Calibrating anomaly duration as a proxy for leak duration,"Across incidents, the duration of flow anomalies aligned with leak events allows mapping anomaly duration to typical leak lifetime.",3,"Uses incident timing to infer leak length; moderate reconstruction risk."
Identifying over-sensitive leak sensing in high-flow areas,"Zones that log many small leak events whenever there is a moderate flow anomaly, with minimal actual damage, indicate overly sensitive leak detection relative to flow conditions.",3,"Zone-level sensor sensitivity insight; some location/timing exposure."
Characterizing system stress evolution over time,An increase over months in both flow anomaly frequency and leak density suggests an aging system under growing hydraulic stress.,2,"Long-term trend analysis; low personal or event-specific risk."
Demand pattern learning with risk overlay,Flow anomalies that align with predictable high-demand periods but only occasionally cause leaks help identify high-risk usage patterns.,3,"Reveals usage schedules and risk overlay; moderate behavior sensitivity."
Anomaly miss cost estimation,"For leaks that occurred without prior flow anomalies, the resulting damage defines the cost of missed anomaly detection and informs stricter anomaly thresholds.",3,"Links missed detections to damage estimates; incident-specific but limited identity exposure."
