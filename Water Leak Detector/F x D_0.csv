Inference,Description,Score,Short rationale
Anomaly-to-alert reaction time,The time gap between the start of a flow anomaly and the first device activation in the same zone measures anomaly-to-alert reaction time.,2,Mostly about system responsiveness; weak indirect signal of whether humans are slow/fast to react.
Unmitigated flow anomalies,Flow anomalies that begin and end with no device activations in their window represent unmitigated anomalies where the system detected unusual flow but never acted.,1,"Flags detected-but-unhandled events; risk and configuration, not behavior."
Effectiveness of automatic shutoff devices,"For anomalies where a shutoff valve or similar device activates, a rapid decline or termination of the anomaly afterward indicates successful mitigation.",1,Measures mitigation quality after activation; device performance only.
Flow anomalies treated as benign,Flow anomalies that recur with similar shape and magnitude and consistently do not trigger device activations represent patterns deemed benign by current rules.,1,"Encodes which patterns rules ignore; reflects policy/config, not people."
False-positive alert detection,"Device activations that occur in time windows without any corresponding flow anomaly indicate alerts triggered by other signals, noise, or misconfiguration.",1,"Shows alerts without anomalies; about noise/misconfig, not users."
Threshold tuning using anomaly–alert correlation,Comparing which flow anomalies do trigger activations versus those that do not reveals an implicit flow threshold that drives device actions.,1,Extracts implicit thresholds from history; configuration signal.
Distinguishing genuine anomaly response from scheduled tests,Device activations that follow no anomaly and occur at regular intervals can be classified as scheduled system tests rather than responses to real anomalies.,2,Regular test patterns reveal maintenance schedules/ops habits at property level.
Evaluating user vs. automated responses,"Very short anomaly-to-activation intervals point to automated actions, while longer and more variable intervals indicate manual user-triggered responses.",3,"Directly separates automatic vs manual responses, exposing when humans act and how quickly."
Measuring anomaly duration reduction due to devices,Comparing anomaly durations with device activations to those without shows how much devices shorten abnormal flow events.,1,Compares durations with/without devices; effectiveness metric only.
Identifying under-responsive zones,Zones with frequent or severe flow anomalies but few or slow device activations are under-responsive and need additional devices or faster rules.,2,"Highlights zones where anomalies get little response; property risk map, mild behavior/policy implication."
Over-instrumented zones (alert spam),"Zones where many device activations occur in response to small, short-lived anomalies are likely over-instrumented or have overly aggressive triggers.",1,Indicates overly aggressive triggering; config/design issue.
Multi-device coordination effectiveness,"For large anomalies where multiple devices activate, anomalies that end quickly afterward demonstrate the benefit of coordinated multi-device responses.",1,Shows benefit of coordinating devices; purely technical.
Cascading anomaly-handling quality,"When a large anomaly triggers an initial device but only terminates after a second escalation activation, escalation stages are shown to be important for full mitigation.",1,"Evaluates escalation stages; control strategy, not personal info."
Detection of benign but noisy flow conditions,Repeated anomalies that always lead to activations but never relate to real issues suggest noisy flow conditions that should be deprioritized or filtered.,1,"Tags noisy conditions; helps rule tuning, not user profiling."
Time-of-day dependence in anomaly response,"If anomalies at night tend to have longer anomaly-to-activation times than those during working hours, response speed is time-of-day dependent.",2,"Night vs daytime response speeds reflect operational/attention patterns, but only weakly tie to identity."
Using anomaly recurrence after resolution to detect incomplete fixes,"When an anomaly ends after device activation but similar anomalies recur shortly afterward, the underlying issue was not properly fixed.",1,Indicates repair quality; maintenance outcome.
Inferring device malfunction from non-effect on anomalies,"If a device frequently activates during anomalies but anomaly magnitude and duration remain similar to events without that device, the device may be ineffective or malfunctioning.",1,Detects malfunctioning devices; technical state only.
Calibration of critical anomaly patterns,"Anomalies that always trigger activations and are externally classified as serious become canonical critical patterns, distinct from anomalies that seldom require action.",1,Labels certain anomalies as “critical”; policy/engineering info.
Separating upstream vs. downstream anomaly handling,"If anomalies on an upstream main line consistently trigger main shutoff activations while branch-level anomalies trigger local devices, patterns confirm an intended upstream/downstream policy.",1,Confirms intended control policy by line level; structural.
Learning anomaly patterns that safely self-resolve,Flow anomalies that reliably self-resolve without any device activation and cause no damage can be tagged as self-resolving anomalies to avoid unnecessary actions.,1,"Marks self-resolving anomalies; helps avoid overreaction, not behavioral."
Detecting configuration drift or rule changes,"If anomalies of a given magnitude historically always led to activations but later similar anomalies do not, the anomaly–activation relationship shows configuration changes or rule drift.",1,Shows when rules/config change over time; admin/system-level.
Estimating miss cost of unhandled anomalies,"For anomalies without device activation that are later associated with damage or leaks, these events define the cost of not acting on that anomaly type.",1,Quantifies damage from unhandled events; risk assessment.
Mapping device coverage to anomaly types,Different anomaly shapes that trigger different subsets of devices reveal how well each device type covers different anomaly types.,1,Links devices to anomaly types they handle; coverage map.
Classifying nuisance anomalies from response history,Anomaly types that repeatedly generate device activations but consistently correspond to no real issue can be tagged as nuisance anomalies and deprioritized.,1,"Tags nuisance patterns; again about tuning, not people."
Joint anomaly–activation fingerprints for incident classification,"For each incident, the combination of anomaly shape, which devices activated, and how quickly they did so forms a fingerprint for classifying incidents into specific categories.",2,"Rich fingerprints could, when joined with other data, support finer-grained incident and behavior profiling, but still mainly technical."
