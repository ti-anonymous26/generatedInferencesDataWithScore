Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Wet-without-flow events (external or surface water),"Moisture spikes that occur without any nearby flow anomaly indicate water sources not related to the supply system, such as rain ingress, cleaning, or condensation.",3,"Identifies external/surface water by location; moderate sensitivity."
Flow-without-wetness events (remote or contained use),"Flow anomalies that do not produce elevated moisture at local sensors indicate abnormal but contained water use elsewhere, such as remote fixtures, tank filling, or good drainage.",2,"Contained usage characterization; low privacy impact."
Leak-like events without explicit leak sensor,"Large or prolonged flow anomalies followed by significant, sustained moisture increases in nearby sensors strongly indicate a leak even if no dedicated leak detector fired.",4,"Strong evidence of leaks with location/timing; high reconstruction risk."
Discriminating heavy usage vs. leakage,"Flow anomalies followed only by small, short-lived moisture changes are likely heavy but contained usage, whereas anomalies followed by large or long-lived moisture spikes indicate leakage or overflow.",3,"Separates usage vs. leak by outcomes; moderate sensitivity."
Drainage performance estimation,"After a flow anomaly, the time it takes for moisture levels to return to baseline quantifies drainage and drying efficiency in that area.",3,"Recovery timing per area; moderate location/timeline exposure."
Subsurface or hidden leak identification,"Flow anomalies with small or delayed moisture increases at surface sensors indicate leaks in hidden spaces, such as inside walls, ceilings, or subfloors.",5,"Hidden leak inference with location context; high reconstruction sensitivity."
Event localization refinement,"When a flow anomaly is detected at an upstream level, the first moisture sensors to spike indicate the most likely physical leak location.",5,"Pinpoints origin via earliest moisture; high location specificity."
Water migration path mapping,"The temporal order in which moisture sensors rise after a flow anomaly reveals the path water takes as it spreads across floors, rooms, or structural elements.",4,"Maps spread path; location/timeline sensitive."
Early warning from micro-flow anomalies,Repeated small flow anomalies that consistently precede slight moisture increases at the same zone form an early-warning pattern for developing micro-leaks.,4,"Precursors tied to zone/time; moderate-to-high sensitivity."
Validating or correcting sensor placement,"If certain flow anomalies are known to cause leaks but never produce moisture changes at local sensors, moisture sensors in that zone are likely poorly placed or too sparse.",3,"Sensor placement diagnostic; moderate location exposure."
Correlating anomaly magnitude with wet footprint,Larger flow anomalies that consistently produce wider or higher moisture footprints support a calibration between anomaly magnitude and expected physical spread of water.,3,"Calibration using incident outcomes; moderate detail."
Characterizing slow absorbing leaks vs. fast spills,"Flow anomalies with modest peaks followed by slowly rising, long-tail moisture indicate absorbing leaks, while anomalies causing sharp moisture spikes indicate fast surface spills or bursts.",3,"Classifies leak behavior; moderate incident specificity."
Overly sensitive flow anomaly thresholds,Frequent flow anomaly alerts that rarely coincide with any noticeable moisture change suggest that flow thresholds are set too low or are reacting to benign fluctuations.,2,"Threshold tuning insight; low privacy impact."
Overly insensitive moisture thresholds,Flow anomalies that clearly represent large events yet only cause very small or no moisture excursions above threshold indicate that moisture alert thresholds may be too strict.,2,"Threshold tuning insight; low privacy impact."
Distinguishing supply-side issues from post-fixture spills,"Flow anomalies in the main line followed by widespread moisture increases suggest supply-side failures, while localized moisture after fixture-specific anomalies suggests overflow or spillage at that fixture.",4,"Cause differentiation with spatial spread; location-sensitive."
Temporal coupling strength between flow and moisture,The typical time lag between a flow anomaly and the first moisture rise in a zone defines a flow-to-wetness coupling for that part of the system.,3,"Coupling metric per zone; moderate sensitivity."
Persistent low-level dampness with intermittent flow anomalies,"Zones with low but persistent moisture and intermittent small flow anomalies indicate a chronic, low-rate leak rather than isolated accidents.",4,"Chronic leak signature with location/time; high sensitivity."
Detecting well-contained high-flow events,"Very large flow anomalies that consistently produce little or no moisture elevation at surrounding sensors imply that high flows are well-contained within pipes, drains, or designated channels.",2,"Identifies contained flow; low privacy risk."
