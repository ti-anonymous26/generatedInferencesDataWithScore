Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Freeze‑burst leak identification,A flow anomaly followed by leak detection during or after sub‑freezing temperature readings indicates freeze‑burst pipe failure.,4,"Event-specific freeze rupture with timing and context; high reconstruction risk."
Hot‑water circuit leak classification,Flow anomalies plus elevated pipe temperatures and leak detection confirm leaks specifically in hot‑water lines rather than cold‑water plumbing.,4,"Identifies leak location by circuit; exposes infrastructure layout and incident timing."
Thermal‑stress precursor detection,"If temperature rapidly fluctuates, followed by a small flow anomaly and then a leak detection, the pattern reflects temperature‑induced material fatigue leading to leakage.",4,"Precursor pattern with timeline; enables forecasting and detailed incident tracing."

Temperature‑dependent anomaly filtering,"Flow anomalies that occur only during temperature extremes are high‑priority alerts, while those occurring during stable temperature regimes are lower risk unless followed by leak detection.",3,"Prioritization logic using context; limited personal inference."

Distinguishing appliance‑related hot spikes from leaks,Transient hot temperature spikes paired with flow anomalies but no leak detection suggest appliance cycles rather than leaks.,4,"Attributes events to appliance use, revealing occupant activity patterns."

Detecting faulty flow sensors using temperature‑leak patterns,"If leak detections occur alongside temperature anomalies but flow anomalies are repeatedly absent, flow sensors may be malfunctioning.",2,"Sensor fault indication; low privacy impact beyond event timestamps."
Recognizing thermal‑flow signatures unique to burst pipes,Burst pipes show abrupt temperature shifts combined with high‑magnitude flow anomalies immediately prior to leak detection.,4,"Distinct burst signature with timing; high incident specificity."
Temporal ordering classification,Flow anomaly → temperature deviation → leak detection indicates pressure‑induced rupture; temperature deviation → flow anomaly → leak detection suggests thermally driven pipe fatigue.,3,"Uses sequence patterns to classify cause; moderate sensitivity."
