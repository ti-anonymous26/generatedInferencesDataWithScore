Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Validating real vs. false alerts,"When a device activates and moisture is already high or rises soon after, the alert corresponds to a real wet event; activations with flat moisture indicate false or test alerts.",3,"Activation + moisture correlation validates events; moderate incident specificity."
Missed wet events,"If moisture rises above a defined threshold and stays elevated but no device activation occurs nearby in time, that wet event was not alerted.",4,"Exposes unalerted wet incidents with timing; higher reconstruction risk."
Over-sensitive alert configuration,"Frequent device activations accompanied only by tiny, short-lived moisture blips or none at all indicate overly sensitive alert rules.",2,"Highlights noisy activations; low privacy impact."
Dry-out confirmation after resolution,"After a device indicates resolution, moisture returning to baseline confirms that the incident is physically resolved.",2,"Resolution check; limited sensitivity."
Time-to-dry after intervention,The time from first device activation or resolution status to moisture dropping back below baseline is the drying time after intervention.,3,"Recovery timing per incident; moderate exposure."
Prioritizing alerts by moisture severity,"Device activations that coincide with high peak moisture and long elevated moisture durations indicate more severe incidents than those with small, brief moisture changes.",4,"Severity prioritization per event; detailed but technical."
Tuning moisture thresholds for alerting,Comparing moisture levels in events that did trigger device activations versus those that did not reveals the effective moisture threshold currently in use.,3,"Threshold tuning using outcomes; moderate incident detail."
Silent chronic dampness,Locations where moisture slowly rises and stays elevated for long periods without any device activation indicate chronic dampness that is not being alerted.,4,"Reveals unalerted dampness by location; notable location sensitivity."
Response timing vs. moisture peak,Comparing the time of first device activation to the time of maximum moisture level for each incident shows whether action was early or late relative to the wetness peak.,3,"Mitigation timing per incident; moderate exposure."
Comparing devices by moisture reduction impact,"For incidents where different devices activate, comparing moisture decay rates after each activation shows which devices reduce dampness fastest.",3,"Device effectiveness comparison; moderate incident detail."
Recognizing test activations,Devices that activate on a regular schedule while moisture remains flat can be tagged as test or self-check routines.,2,"Identifies routine tests; low privacy impact."
Escalation effectiveness,"When moisture remains high after initial activation but starts falling quickly after escalated activations, escalation is effective.",3,"Evaluates escalation per incident; moderate sensitivity."
Residual dampness after resolved state,"If moisture stays above baseline for a long time after all related devices deactivate, there is residual dampness that outlives the reported resolution.",3,"Post-incident persistence; moderate timeline exposure."
Alert fatigue signature,Repeated activations in the same zone with similar or increasing moisture profiles suggest users are acknowledging or silencing alerts without fully fixing or drying the area.,4,"Indicates user behavior/patterns; higher privacy sensitivity."
Sensor–device coverage gaps,"If a sensor repeatedly logs significant moisture peaks in a zone where no devices ever activate, that zone is monitored but not protected.",4,"Highlights protection gaps by zone; location-sensitive."
Proactive vs. reactive devices,"Device activations that typically occur just before moisture begins to rise are proactive, while those that consistently trail moisture spikes are reactive.",3,"Response classification using timing; moderate sensitivity."
Verifying dehumidifier or pump performance,"When a pump or dehumidifier activates and moisture then trends downward, the device is effective; activation with flat or rising moisture suggests underperformance or failure.",3,"Performance check per incident; moderate exposure."
Local vs. widespread damp incidents,"A single activation followed by moisture rises at many sensors indicates a widespread damp incident, while activations accompanied by moisture change at only nearby sensors indicate a localized event.",3,"Scope classification; moderate location sensitivity."
Time-of-day dependency in damp-response,"If moisture spikes at night typically see longer delays before device activation than similar spikes during the day, response is time-of-day dependent.",4,"Time-of-day patterns reveal presence/behavior; higher sensitivity."
Ranking zones by wet unmitigated time,"For each zone, summing periods where moisture is above threshold and no device is active yields wet-unmitigated time for that zone.",3,"Zone-level metric; location/history sensitive."
Detecting premature all-clear,"If devices deactivate while moisture is still elevated or soon rises again, all clear was declared too early.",3,"Shows premature resolution with timelines; moderate exposure."
Distinguishing nuisance dampness vs. critical dampness,"Device activations tied to small, quickly resolving moisture peaks represent nuisance damp events, while those tied to high, long-lasting moisture plateaus represent critical damp events.",3,"Severity classification per event; moderate detail."
Trend-based classification: chronic vs. episodic damp,"Zones with rising baseline moisture and occasional small activations exhibit chronic environmental damp, while zones with sharp moisture spikes tightly coupled to occasional activations are episodic incident zones.",4,"Chronic vs. episodic mapping by zone; location/history sensitivity."
Policy gaps in high-risk damp zones,"If a zone frequently exhibits large or long moisture excursions yet device activations there are rare or delayed, policy is underreacting relative to risk.",4,"Shows under-response in specific zones; location-sensitive."
Learning moisture-informed activation rules,"Over time, the system can compare moisture patterns that historically led to helpful device activations versus those that did not, and refine activation rules accordingly.",3,"Rule tuning from history; moderate incident detail."
