Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Cross-validating true leak events via tri-signal agreement,"A leak detection paired with moisture rise and device activation in the same window forms a high-confidence confirmed leak, reducing ambiguity from any single signal.",4,"Event-level confirmation with activation timing; strong reconstruction and location context."
Detecting leak sensor false positives using moisture and device inactivity,Leak detections not accompanied by moisture elevation or device activation suggest false positives or sensor malfunction.,3,"Flags false alarms via missing corroboration; limited behavior exposure beyond timestamps."
Identifying missed leak events through moisture and device behavior,"If moisture rises and devices activate but no leak detection entry is recorded, the leak sensor failed to report a real leak event.",4,"Reveals real incidents with activation and moisture traces despite missing logs; notable event specificity."
Evaluating device response timing relative to leak onset,"Comparing timestamps shows whether device activation occurs before, during, or after leak detection and moisture rise, indicating early or delayed intervention.",3,"Operational timing insight with event timestamps; moderate privacy impact."
Distinguishing slow-seep leaks from sudden bursts,"Slow moisture accumulation with delayed leak detection but early device activation indicates seepage, while rapid moisture spikes and immediate activation indicate bursts.",4,"Classifies leak type and severity with timing; detailed incident fingerprint."
Assessing device effectiveness based on moisture decay after activation,"If moisture decreases rapidly after a device activates in a detected leak, the device (pump, shutoff, alarm) is effective; stagnant moisture suggests limited effect.",3,"Post-activation outcome per incident; limited behavior inference."
Detecting leaks masked by insufficient device activation,Consistent moisture elevation plus leak detection without device activation signals a coverage or policy gap where devices are not responding to leaks.,4,"Shows leaks without mitigation; incident timelines and locations exposed."
Identifying zones needing additional devices,Locations repeatedly showing leak detections and moisture spikes before any device activation indicate insufficient device presence or poor placement.,4,"Highlights vulnerable zones and repeated events; location-sensitive."
Triangulating early-warning signatures for developing leaks,Patterns of small moisture increases followed by device activation and later leak detection define pre-leak signatures that can be used for predictive alerts.,4,"Precursor patterns with activation/detection timelines; supports forecasting per zone."
Distinguishing nuisance moisture events from leak-associated moisture,"Moisture spikes followed by device activation and leak detection correspond to true leak events, whereas unaccompanied moisture spikes are likely benign.",3,"Separates benign vs. leak events; moderate incident detail."
Evaluating long-term leak remediation effectiveness,"If after a repair, leak detections stop but moisture persists and devices still activate, the leak remediation is incomplete.",3,"Links post-repair timelines to moisture/device activity; moderate sensitivity."
Temporal ordering for incident classification,"Analyzing whether leak detection precedes moisture rise or vice versa helps classify leaks, such as pressure leaks (detected earlier) vs. surface pooling leaks (moisture detected first).",3,"Sequence-based classification; limited personal inference."
Detecting device-trigger-induced moisture drying,Rapid moisture decrease immediately after device activation during a leak incident indicates that the device successfully mitigated water spread.,3,"Shows mitigation effectiveness per event; modest privacy exposure."
Prioritizing critical leak incidents,Leaks that produce both high moisture readings and rapid device activation indicate severe events requiring urgent attention.,4,"Severe event identification with activation timing; strong incident reconstruction."
Identifying leak propagation paths using device activation zones,"When leaks cause sequential device activations in adjacent zones while moisture spreads accordingly, the progression path of the leak becomes inferable.",5,"Sequential activations map leak spread and layout; high location and timeline sensitivity."
Distinguishing deliberate/manual device activations,Device activations occurring without leak detection or moisture rise indicate manual testing or manual overrides rather than leak-driven actions.,4,"Reveals manual user actions and timing; higher behavioral privacy exposure."
Validating leak resolution via multi-signal decay,"A leak is truly resolved when leak detections cease, devices deactivate, and moisture levels return to baseline; mismatch indicates incomplete resolution.",3,"Resolution status per incident; moderate timeline detail."
Detecting stale leak detection logic,"If leak detections recur frequently without corresponding device activation or moisture rise, the detection logic may be firing due to past state persistence or firmware issues.",2,"System diagnostics with minimal occupant detail."
Leak severity scoring via moisture peak and device escalation,"Combining peak moisture levels with the number and type of device activations (e.g., escalation from alarm to shutoff) yields a severity metric for triaging leaks.",4,"Severity scoring per incident with activation levels; detailed but technical."
Learning leak fingerprints via tri-signal patterns,Distinct patterns—such as detection → moisture → activation or moisture → detection → activation—form fingerprints that classify leak types.,3,"Pattern library for classification; moderate incident specificity."
Identifying leaks hidden by fast drainage,"If leak detection fires but moisture peaks are small and device activation quickly reduces moisture, leaks may appear minor despite being structurally significant.",4,"Captures incidents masked by fast drainage with activation timelines; reconstruction risk."
Detecting sporadic micro-leaks,Small moisture increases that trigger device activation but rarely register leak detections indicate micro-leaks below the threshold of leak sensors.,4,"Repeated subtle events with activation logs; reveals persistent issue timing and zones."
Characterizing device activation reliability during leaks,"If devices activate inconsistently across similar leak events with comparable moisture profiles, response reliability varies and may need calibration.",3,"Operational reliability across incidents; limited personal exposure."
Detecting leak amplification events,"Leaks where device activation does not reduce moisture, and moisture continues rising, indicate leak amplification or secondary failures.",4,"Shows worsening incidents despite mitigation; detailed timelines."
Refining device activation thresholds using leak and moisture outcomes,"If some leaks with significant moisture spikes do not trigger device activation, thresholds must be lowered or logic improved.",3,"Policy tuning based on outcomes; moderate incident data without strong behavior profiling."
