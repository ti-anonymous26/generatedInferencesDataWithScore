Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Condensation vs. leak classification,"Moisture spikes that occur when pipe or surface temperatures are near dew point or significantly below ambient are likely condensation, whereas spikes at normal temperatures are more likely leaks or spills.",3,"Separates condensation vs. leaks using temperature; moderate sensitivity."
Cold-surface condensation hotspot detection,"Locations that frequently show low temperatures together with moderate, recurring moisture are condensation hotspots on cold pipes or surfaces.",3,"Identifies condensation-prone zones; location-specific."
Freeze–melt dampness mapping,"Moisture increases that follow periods of sub-freezing pipe temperatures indicate dampness caused by thawing frost or ice, rather than normal use.",3,"Links moisture to freeze/thaw timing; location/time sensitive."
Evaporation rate as a function of temperature,"For similar moisture peaks, the time needed for moisture levels to return to baseline is shorter at higher temperatures and longer at lower temperatures, revealing temperature-dependent drying rates.",2,"Analytical drying behavior; low incident specificity."
Mold-risk zone identification,"Areas that show persistent moderate moisture combined with mild, stable temperatures match conditions favorable for mold growth.",4,"Flags mold-prone zones with history; location-sensitive."
Cold-and-wet structural risk mapping,Zones that are both cold and wet for long durations face high risk of freeze damage as well as long-term material degradation.,4,"Maps cold/wet exposure over time; high location/history sensitivity."
Steam/vapor vs. liquid water discrimination,"Moisture spikes coinciding with very warm pipe temperatures suggest vapor or steam condensation, whereas moisture at moderate temperatures suggests direct liquid leaks or spills.",3,"Distinguishes vapor vs. liquid sources; moderate context sensitivity."
Insulation performance under wet conditions,Locations where temperatures remain low and moisture decays very slowly after getting wet indicate both poor insulation and poor drying.,3,"Identifies poorly insulated, slow-drying zones; location-specific."
Thermal buffering due to water content,"After a wetting event, surfaces whose temperature changes more slowly than nearby dry surfaces show thermal buffering effects from stored water.",2,"Physical effect indicator; low privacy impact."
Seasonal moisture–temperature coupling,"If specific seasons show warmer or more humid conditions together with recurring moisture spikes at the same locations, these periods represent climate-driven damp seasons.",3,"Seasonal patterns per location; moderate sensitivity."
Pre-risk cold-but-dry indicator,Segments that frequently reach very low temperatures while showing little or no moisture are currently safe but highly vulnerable if water ever appears there.,3,"Identifies vulnerable cold zones; location-sensitive."
Freeze-driven moisture vs. usage-driven moisture,"Moisture events that follow sub-freezing periods are likely freeze-driven, while those that occur at normal temperatures during high-usage times are usage-driven.",3,"Cause classification using temperature/usage context; moderate exposure."
Dew-point proximity event tagging,"When surface or pipe temperature dips close to dew point and moisture rises soon after, the event can be tagged as dew-point condensation.",2,"Condensation tagging; low personal impact."
Identifying wet-but-warm comfort issues,Areas that are frequently moist and relatively warm can be flagged as comfort and odor risk zones even if structural risk is moderate.,4,"Comfort/odor risk zones with history; location-sensitive."
Thermal drying inefficiency,"If moisture remains elevated even when temperature is consistently high, thermal conditions are favorable but airflow or drainage is inadequate.",3,"Shows drying inefficiency; moderate incident detail."
"Cold, fast-dry vs. cold, slow-dry discrimination","Among cold locations, those where moisture decays quickly differ from those where moisture persists; the latter have a moisture-retention problem beyond just low temperature.",3,"Cold-zone comparison; location-specific."
Climate-driven vs. plumbing-driven damp clusters,"Moisture clusters that align with temperature swings or cold/hot weather are climate-driven, while those at steady temperatures are more likely plumbing or behavior driven.",3,"Classifies damp causes; moderate location/context sensitivity."
Condensation risk after hot usage,"After hot-water use, if pipe temperatures drop rapidly below ambient and moisture rises, it indicates post-heating condensation on cooling surfaces.",3,"Usage-linked condensation; moderate occupancy signal."
Identifying zones where heating alone cannot dry,"If raising temperature does not significantly accelerate moisture decay in a region, heating alone is insufficient to dry it and drainage or ventilation changes are needed.",3,"Highlights zones needing ventilation/drainage; location-specific."
Mapping long-term saturation under thermal cycling,Locations where moisture rarely returns to baseline despite repeated warm–cool cycles show long-term saturation of materials.,4,"Long-term saturation mapping; location/history sensitive."
Differentiating external weather dampness from internal leaks,"Moisture events that align with low pipe temperatures and known cold or humid weather, but not with internal usage, are likely external weather effects rather than internal leaks.",3,"Weather-linked damp vs. internal leaks; moderate sensitivity."
Overheating-linked condensation in cold rooms,"In cold rooms, if local heating briefly warms pipes or surfaces above room air and then temperature falls back with moisture rise, it indicates transient overheating followed by condensation.",3,"Transient condensation pattern; location-specific."
Localized thermal–moisture asymmetry across sensors,"If adjacent sensors show similar temperatures but only one shows frequent moisture spikes, local micro-environment factors like airflow or geometry explain the dampness asymmetry.",3,"Asymmetry highlights micro-environment issues; location/timing sensitive."
Ranking zones by cold-wet hours,"Summing periods where temperature is below a threshold and moisture above a threshold yields cold-wet exposure time per zone, highlighting areas at highest freeze and degradation risk.",4,"Exposure metric per zone; high location/history sensitivity."
Pre-freeze saturation risk,"If moisture remains elevated while temperature trends downward toward freezing, there is increased risk of water freezing in place and causing expansion damage.",3,"Combines moisture with falling temperature; moderate incident specificity."
