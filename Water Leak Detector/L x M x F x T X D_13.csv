Inference,Description,score,short rationale
"Ground-truth, fully validated leak incidents","Incidents where flow anomalies, moisture spikes, temperature deviation, leak records, and device activations all align in time and space are fully validated 'ground truth' leaks.",5,"Specific leak incidents tied to locations, timestamps, and device actions; strong potential for profiling and property risk."
End-to-end pipeline health (sensing → decision → action),Comparing the sequence flow anomaly → moisture change → leak detection → device activation → signals returning to normal reveals how well the full chain from sensing to physical mitigation works under different temperatures.,2,"Aggregated system reliability view; limited personal behavior exposure."
Causal pattern for thermally driven burst leaks,"Patterns of sub-freezing temperatures, followed by sharp flow anomalies, rapid moisture rise, leak detection, and fast device activation define a canonical causal chain for freeze–burst events.",3,"Shows building vulnerability to freeze-related failures; minimal direct occupant inference."
Causal pattern for overheating-induced failures,"Episodes where elevated temperatures precede flow anomalies, moisture spikes, leak records, and mitigation actions characterize overheating-related failures such as gasket or seal degradation and pressure expansion.",3,"Reveals structural risk from heat-driven failures more than individual behavior."
Separation of condensation or humidity events from plumbing leaks,"Events with moisture rise at low or ambient temperatures but no flow anomaly, no leak record, and no device activation, contrasted with events where all five signals activate, let the system separate condensation or surface humidity from true plumbing leaks.",3,"Distinguishes environmental moisture versus leaks; may hint at activities (showers/steam) but low identity exposure."
True-positive vs. false-positive leak detection quality,"Leak records that coincide with flow anomalies, moisture spikes, temperature anomalies, and device actions are true positives; records that lack such corroboration are likely false positives.",3,"Indicates when real leaks occur and are confirmed; some event timing but limited broader profiling."
True-negative vs. false-negative leak behaviour,"Episodes where flow anomalies, moisture elevation, and temperature stress occur, devices activate, but no leak record appears indicate false negatives in leak detection.",3,"Highlights misses or overreactions around leak events; reveals incident presence but not personal details."
Temperature-aware leak severity index,"A composite severity index can be built from flow anomaly magnitude and duration, peak and duration of moisture elevation, intensity of temperature deviation from safe range, length and escalation level of device activations, and frequency and duration of leak records.",5,"Detailed severity metrics per incident enable damage assessment and reconstruction; high re-identification risk."
Detection of leaks hidden under high usage and thermal noise,"During high demand and fluctuating temperatures, small flow anomalies may be ambiguous; when they consistently co-occur with localized moisture rise, leak logs, and device activations, the system can infer leaks that would be invisible from any single signal alone.",4,"Uses usage and temperature context to surface leaks, exposing patterns of activity and system response."
Thermally modulated micro-leak identification,"Patterns where small flow anomalies and low-level moisture increases only appear during specific temperature bands, repeatedly lead to leak records, and cause device activations indicate micro-leaks sensitive to thermal expansion or contraction.",4,"Repeated subtle anomalies tied to temperature reveal persistent weaknesses and timing of building use."
Estimating leak volume with environment-aware correction,"Leak volume can be estimated by integrating flow anomaly over time and correcting using the duration and magnitude of moisture elevation, pipe temperature, and how long devices run while leak records remain active.",5,"Quantifies leak volume and timing precisely; high risk for property valuation and incident reconstruction."
Repair success and durability under normal and extreme conditions,"After a repair, absence of flow anomalies, abnormal moisture, leak logs, and device activations during both normal and extreme temperature episodes indicates durable success.",3,"Shows maintenance history and efficacy; moderate sensitivity about service timing."
Multi-stage failure chain discovery,Sequences such as temp drift → small flow anomalies → subtle moisture trends → first leak detection → repeated device activations → larger anomalies reveal multi-stage failure mechanisms.,4,"Maps step-by-step escalation with timestamps; exposes incident timelines and locations."
Distinguishing supply-side leaks from drainage or backflow issues,"Events dominated by moisture rise, often at near-ambient temperature, with little or no supply-side flow anomaly, minimal or no leak record, but drainage device activation suggest drainage or backflow problems; incidents where strong flow anomalies, leak logs, and shutoff device activations align indicate supply-side leaks.",3,"Identifies plumbing source type; moderate detail on fault location but limited personal behavior."
Pipeline insulation and routing risk mapping,"Zones where extreme temperatures repeatedly align with flow anomalies, moisture spikes, leak records, and device activations form a map of thermally vulnerable sections.",4,"Creates a map of vulnerable sections; reveals building layout and weak points."
Learning leak fingerprints for automated classification,"By clustering full 5D incident profiles—shapes of flow, moisture, temperature, timing of leak logs, and patterns of device activations—the system can learn fingerprints for freeze bursts, hot-water coil failures, slow joint seepage, appliance overflows, and external ingress.",3,"Pattern library of incident shapes; some profiling of infrastructure but less tied to individuals."
Early-warning scoring for imminent failure,"Patterns of repeated temperature stress, small flow anomalies, slight moisture upticks, occasional device activations, and no leak logs yet can be scored as pre-failure risk for each zone.",4,"Zone-level risk scores based on repeated precursors; indicates vulnerable areas and timing of stress."
Evaluating control logic (proactive vs. reactive) under real conditions,"If device activations tend to occur before or right at the start of flow anomalies and before major moisture rise, using temperature as the trigger and are then followed by absence or reduction of leak detection, the control policy is proactive; if they consistently lag behind leak records and high moisture or flow, it is reactive.",2,"Assesses system timing relative to events; mostly operational logic with limited personal context."
Ranking sensors and devices by real-world impact,"For each sensor or device, comparing how its presence affects the frequency and volume of flow anomalies, peak and duration of moisture, occurrence of leak logs, behaviour under different temperatures, and amount and frequency of device actions allows ranking elements by actual contribution to risk reduction.",2,"Performance benchmarking of hardware; minimal exposure of occupant behavior."
Detecting instrumentation faults via cross-inconsistency,"Flow sensor faults appear when leak logs, moisture spikes, thermal anomalies, and device actions occur without any recorded flow anomalies; moisture sensor faults when the same happens without moisture changes; temperature sensor faults when leaks and device behaviour are invariant over reported temperature; device log faults when physical conditions change without any recorded activation.",2,"Flags sensor faults using cross-checks; low direct privacy risk aside from incident timestamps."
Estimating damage potential beyond water volume,"Damage potential increases when a leak occurs during temperature extremes, shows large flow anomalies, sustains high moisture for long, is logged repeatedly in leak history, and triggers prolonged or repeated device activations.",4,"Combines severity signals to gauge damage; reveals magnitude, duration, and context of incidents."
Post-incident recovery trajectory analysis,"After an incident, the joint decay of flow, moisture, and temperature deviations, plus the timing of leak log closure and device deactivation, describe the recovery trajectory, highlighting fast, normal, slow, or incomplete recoveries.",3,"Shows how conditions normalize after leaks; contains event timelines but limited personal inference."
Inferring vertical vs. lateral propagation of leaks,"When a leak begins from leak detection and flow anomaly at one elevation but the earliest moisture rise and temperature deviation occur elsewhere and devices activate in a spatial sequence, the combined data reveals whether water is moving vertically or laterally.",4,"Spatial propagation reveals structure and multi-zone involvement; moderate re-identification risk for location."
Distinguishing one big event from multiple smaller events,"By examining continuity and correlation across flow, moisture, temperature, leak logs, and device activations, the system can tell whether a long disturbance is one extended leak or several separate incidents.",3,"Segmenting disturbances exposes occurrence timing; moderate sensitivity."
Policy-gap identification under specific conditions,"Conditions where extreme temperature, notable flow anomalies, and elevated moisture occur repeatedly in the same area, with occasional leak detections but rarely or never any device activation, indicate a policy gap: high physical risk but weak automated response.",3,"Points out conditions with risk but no response; reveals repeated stressful situations per zone."
Adaptive threshold learning from real outcomes,"Using outcomes of past incidents, the system can learn optimal joint thresholds in the space of flow anomaly, moisture change, temperature context, leak probability, and device actions so that historically damaging combinations trigger stronger actions.",3,"Uses historical incidents to tune thresholds; embeds outcome history but aggregated."
Day–night and seasonal reliability profiling,"Comparing how flow, moisture, leak, and device patterns behave under different temperature regimes such as night versus day and winter versus summer exposes time- and season-dependent blind spots.",3,"Time-of-day and seasonal patterns can reveal occupancy schedules; moderate privacy exposure."
Differentiating occupant-driven events from autonomous system issues,"Events with flow anomalies and mild moisture, at moderate temperatures, with short device activations and few or no leak detections likely represent occupant behaviour; incidents with strong alignment of all five signals, especially under thermal stress, likely represent infrastructure failure.",5,"Explicitly attributes events to occupants versus system, disclosing behavior and presence."
Holistic leak lifecycle modelling,"From first subtle temperature drift and flow anomalies, through rising moisture, initial leak log, escalation of device activations, and eventual decay of all signals, the system can model the typical lifecycle of different leak types.",4,"Full lifecycle traces timing, escalation, and mitigation, enabling detailed incident reconstruction."
Long-term infrastructure risk scoring per zone,"For each zone, aggregating over time the count and type of leak detections, cumulative exposure to high moisture, frequency and magnitude of flow anomalies, amount of time in risky temperature ranges, and intensity and recurrence of device activations yields a long-term structural risk score.",4,"Aggregates long-term risk per zone; reveals persistent problem areas and incident history."
