Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Post-leak drying time,"For each leak event, the time from leak detection to moisture returning to baseline at that location estimates the drying time.",3,"Event timelines per location; moderate location sensitivity."
Residual dampness after “fixed” leaks,"If leak history shows no new leaks at a location but moisture remains elevated for days, residual dampness is present.",3,"Shows lingering moisture at specific spots; moderate location/timeline exposure."
Hidden leak candidates (moisture without leaks),Locations with repeated moisture spikes but no corresponding leak events in history are probable hidden or undetected leaks.,4,"Reveals unlogged leaks at specific locations; notable location sensitivity."
False leak alerts (leaks without moisture),Leak events that are never followed by any measurable moisture change around them are likely false positives or dry anomalies.,2,"Flags false leak records; low privacy beyond timestamps."
Leak severity estimation from moisture profile,"For each leak, the peak moisture level and the duration above a threshold from logs provide a severity score for that leak event.",4,"Per-incident severity with timing; supports detailed reconstruction."
Total damage potential per location,Combine number of leaks at a location with total time that moisture stayed above a critical level there to estimate damage potential.,4,"Aggregates severity and duration per location; location/history sensitivity."
Water spread radius from each leak,"After a leak event, the set of moisture sensors that show rising values and their distances from the leak location give a spread radius.",4,"Maps spread across sensors; high location and layout exposure."
Structural drainage efficiency per zone,"Compare, for similar-sized leaks, how quickly moisture decays at different locations to assess drainage efficiency.",3,"Compares drying across zones; moderate location sensitivity."
Leak location refinement using moisture peaks,"When the leak event is logged at coarse resolution, the sensor with the earliest and strongest moisture rise indicates the likely exact leak point.",4,"Pinpoints origin using earliest peak; high location specificity."
Distinguishing plumbing leaks from surface events,"Sustained leak entries with repeated moisture spikes at plumbing spots indicate plumbing leaks, while moisture spikes without leaks suggest surface water sources.",3,"Differentiates cause with location context; moderate sensitivity."
Response delay impact on moisture damage,"For each leak, comparing the time from detection to peak moisture level reveals how intervention delay affects severity.",3,"Incident timelines for mitigation speed; moderate reconstruction risk."
Recurrent leak site characterization,Locations that repeatedly show the pattern ‘leak event → moisture spike → slow drying’ are recurrent failure sites.,3,"Marks recurrent problem sites; location/history exposure."
Intermittent vs. continuous leak behavior,Multiple small leak events with separate moisture peaks suggest intermittent failures; one leak event with a long moisture plateau suggests a continuous leak.,3,"Behavior classification per location; moderate detail."
Prioritization of maintenance zones,Rank locations using both leak frequency and average or total moisture-above-threshold time to prioritize maintenance.,3,"Ranking of zones by leak/moisture history; location-sensitive."
Seasonal vulnerability of specific locations,"At some locations, leak events cluster in certain seasons and those leaks also exhibit longer moisture persistence during those periods.",3,"Seasonal patterns tied to locations; moderate sensitivity."
Capillary migration evidence,Leak events near the floor followed by delayed moisture increases in higher-mounted sensors indicate capillary rise through materials.,4,"Reveals vertical water movement; location and timing sensitive."
Hidden cavity or void detection,Small leak events that yield large or delayed moisture footprints at non-adjacent sensors imply water accumulation in hidden cavities.,4,"Suggests hidden pathways/cavities; location and timing exposure."
Porous vs. non-porous construction zones,"For leaks of similar size, locations where moisture decays slowly indicate more porous materials; fast decay indicates less porous surfaces.",3,"Material characteristics per zone; moderate location sensitivity."
Leak detector coverage gaps,"Areas where moisture repeatedly spikes without any leak events, while nearby zones show both, indicate gaps in leak sensor coverage or sensitivity.",3,"Highlights coverage gaps by location; moderate sensitivity."
Distinguishing one large leak from many small leaks,A single leak event associated with a long continuous moisture plateau differs from multiple shorter moisture peaks tied to separate leak records.,3,"Classifies leak pattern; moderate incident specificity."
Post-remediation effectiveness check,"Before vs. after remediation, comparing leak frequency and moisture decay times at the same locations shows whether fixes were effective.",3,"Pre/post maintenance evaluation per location; moderate timeline exposure."
Leakage pathway consistency over multiple events,"If different leak events in the same area produce similar spatial patterns of moisture activation, that pattern reveals a stable water pathway.",4,"Stable pathway mapping; location/layout sensitive."
Refining actual leak start time,"When leak detection triggers only at a threshold, the first detectable rise in moisture can infer an earlier approximate leak start time.",3,"Adjusts start time using moisture rise; moderate event detail."
Upstream vs. local leak inference,A leak event at one location combined with moisture rising first downstream indicates that the leak origin may be upstream of the logged point.,3,"Infers origin relative to sensors; location-sensitive."
Sensor malfunction detection (cross-checking),"If most locations show leaks accompanied by moisture changes but one sensor repeatedly shows only leaks or only moisture, that sensor may be faulty.",2,"Sensor diagnostics; low personal exposure."
Occupancy-driven damage escalation,Comparing moisture duration for leaks during likely absence vs. presence shows that unattended leaks typically cause longer wet periods.,4,"Links damage duration to occupancy/presence; higher behavioral sensitivity."
Effectiveness of early leak detection,"Leaks detected early show shallower and shorter moisture profiles, while late-detected leaks show higher peaks and longer durations.",3,"Evaluates detection timing vs. severity; moderate incident exposure."
Differentiating first-time vs. chronic problem zones,Locations with a single leak and normal moisture behavior differ from locations with many leaks and increasingly slower drying after each one.,3,"Distinguishes one-off vs. chronic zones; location/history sensitive."
