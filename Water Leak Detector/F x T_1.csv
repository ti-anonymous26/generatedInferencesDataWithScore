Inference,Description,Score,Short rationale
Hot-line vs. cold-line anomaly classification,"Flow anomalies that coincide with high temperatures belong to hot-water circuits, while anomalies at low temperatures belong to cold-water lines, allowing classification of which part of the network is involved.",1,Just labels anomalies as hot vs cold circuits; mainly topology.
Freeze-related burst detection,Large flow anomalies that occur right after pipe temperatures rise from sub-freezing to above 0°C are likely caused by ice plugs breaking and pipes bursting.,1,"Detects ice-plug bursts; pure failure mode, not behavior."
Demand-driven vs. failure-driven anomalies,"Flow anomalies at normal, user-typical temperatures are more likely demand peaks, whereas anomalies at extreme cold or hot temperatures are more likely failures.",2,"Uses “user-typical” temps vs extremes to classify, weak behavior signal."
Heater malfunction with abnormal flow,"Flow anomalies in the hot-water loop combined with unexpectedly low temperatures indicate that water is moving but not being heated properly, suggesting heater malfunction.",1,Indicates heater fault while water moves; device health only.
Thermal shock event detection,"Flow anomalies that cause rapid large temperature swings, such as cold-to-very-hot or hot-to-very-cold, indicate thermal shock events on pipes.",1,"Large temp swings on pipes; material stress, not personal."
Freeze-risk anomalies with no immediate burst,Flow anomalies at near-freezing temperatures that later return to normal with no immediate leak can be flagged as freeze-stress events that may precede later leaks.,1,Marks freeze-stress events; system risk only.
Recirculation pump fault detection,Frequent short flow anomalies in hot lines with almost constant elevated temperatures suggest a recirculation pump cycling or malfunctioning rather than user demand.,1,Cycling/malfunctioning pump; mechanical behavior.
Energy waste from unnoticed hot-water flow,Flow anomalies at hot-water temperatures during expected inactivity periods reveal hidden hot-water usage or leaks causing unnecessary energy loss.,4,Hot-water flow during expected inactivity exposes away/asleep periods and hidden use/leaks.
Hot-water backflow into cold lines,"A flow anomaly on a cold line combined with a sharp temperature increase on that line signals hot-water backflow, often due to faulty mixing or check valves.",1,Faulty mixing/check valve; plumbing issue.
Cold-water intrusion into hot circuits,"Flow anomalies plus sudden cooling in hot-water pipes indicate cold water intruding into the hot circuit, such as from a mixing valve stuck open.",1,Cold intrusion into hot loop; valve/mixing fault.
Flow-path length estimation via temperature lag,"During a flow anomaly, the time delay between anomaly start and temperature change at a sensor reflects the path length or thermal mass along that route.",1,Uses lag to infer path length/thermal mass; structural.
Weather-driven freeze anomalies,Flow anomalies occurring only when pipe temperatures are very low and tracking outdoor cold spells suggest freeze-related stress rather than random usage.,1,Tied to outdoor cold spells; environment/failure classification.
Differentiating flushing or maintenance from leaks,"Flow anomalies with temperature profiles matching normal supply temperatures during known maintenance windows likely reflect flushing, while anomalies at unusual temperatures outside those windows are more suspicious.",2,Encodes maintenance windows and patterns; mild operational/behavioral info.
Identifying stuck-open hot fixtures,Persistent moderate flow anomalies at hot-water temperatures with minimal user activity indicate a hot tap or valve left partially open.,3,Persistent hot flow with little activity reveals forgotten taps and when they’re left open.
Overheated water risk detection,"Flow anomalies coinciding with temperatures above configured safety limits flag scalding or system overheating risk, not just hydraulic anomaly.",2,Shows system routinely reaches unsafe temps; hints at risky config but weakly personal.
Partial freeze with restricted flow,Flow anomalies with reduced flow compared to normal patterns and very low temperatures indicate partial ice blockage where water still moves but is constricted.,1,Partial ice blockage; structural/failure mode.
Differentiating main-line vs. branch anomalies,"An anomaly paired with uniform temperature changes in multiple branches suggests a main-line event, whereas anomalies with temperature changes localized to one branch suggest a local issue.",1,Distinguishes main vs branch events; network topology.
Leak-like anomalies vs. appliance-like anomalies,"Flow anomalies that maintain nearly constant temperature at the supply level are more leak-like, while anomalies where temperature drifts gradually are more appliance-like.",2,Classifies anomaly as leak vs appliance use; appliance profile is mild behavior signal.
Anomalies caused by temperature-driven demand surges,Flow anomalies in hot water that occur when temperature has just reached user-set comfortable levels from a cold start likely reflect demand surges when users start using hot water.,3,Shows when users start using hot water as it reaches preferred comfort level.
Detecting under-insulated lines from anomaly behavior,Cold-water anomalies whose associated temperature curves show large deviations relative to ambient identify under-insulated segments where flow quickly equilibrates with external conditions.,2,Identifies segments that equilibrate rapidly with ambient; property/efficiency profile.
Identifying anomalies tied to heater cycling,Flow anomalies that coincide with periodic temperature oscillations in the hot circuit indicate coupling to heater on/off cycles rather than leaks.,1,Links anomalies to heater on/off cycles; device behavior.
Cold-seep anomalies during pre-freeze phases,Low-level flow anomalies appearing at just-above-freezing temperatures can mark subtle cold-induced seepage from fittings that shrink slightly before full freezing.,1,Subtle cold-induced seepage; structural only.
Hot-water recirculation inefficiency,Flow anomalies in recirculation loops with only small temperature differences between supply and return show that the loop is wasting energy without delivering a useful temperature gradient.,2,Shows recirc loop wasting energy; building/system efficiency.
Pattern learning for critical thermal anomalies,Flow anomalies that often occur near thermal extremes and are associated with later damage can be labeled as critical patterns distinct from mid-temperature anomalies that rarely cause issues.,1,Labels thermal-extreme patterns as critical; engineering risk model.
Time-of-day and thermal context of anomalies,"Anomalies that occur at night when pipes are coldest versus daytime when pipes are warmer may have different failure probabilities even with similar flow magnitude, showing that flow risk depends on thermal context.",2,Night vs day failure risk patterns reveal mild time-of-day usage/exposure characteristics.
