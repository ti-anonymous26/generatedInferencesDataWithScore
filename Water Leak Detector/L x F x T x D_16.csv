Identifying cascading failure events,Temperature deviation → flow anomaly → leak detection → sequential device activations indicates cascading system failure.,5,"Rich multi-stage timelines and activation order expose detailed failure progression."
Separating structural leaks from pressure surges,"Flow anomalies at high temperature without leak detection but with device activation indicate pressure surges, whereas similar patterns with leak detection confirm structural leakage.",3,"Distinguishes cause using patterns; moderate sensitivity without deep identity exposure."
Temporal fingerprinting for automated leak-type classification,"Patterns such as temperature spike → flow anomaly → leak detection → activation define overheating leaks, while cold dip → flow anomaly → activation → leak detection defines freeze-related leaks.",4,"Signal order fingerprints leak types; detailed sequences useful for profiling incidents."
