Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Triangulated confirmed leak events,"Events where a flow anomaly, a significant moisture increase, and a leak detection record all occur in the same zone and time window form high-confidence, triangulated leak incidents.",5,"Fully triangulated incident with zone and timing; high reconstruction risk."
Distinguishing benign high usage from true leaks,"Flow anomalies that are not followed by moisture elevation and never produce leak detection records represent benign high-usage patterns, whereas anomalies that do show both rising moisture and leak detections are true leaks.",3,"Separates benign usage from leaks; some occupancy inference but limited detail."
Detecting external or non-plumbing water sources,"Episodes with elevated moisture and no nearby flow anomaly or leak detection history suggest water from external sources such as rain ingress, cleaning, or condensation rather than a plumbing leak.",3,"Identifies external water sources like cleaning/weather; moderate context sensitivity."
Hidden or uninstrumented leak identification,Flow anomalies accompanied by rising moisture but with no corresponding leak detection entries indicate likely leaks in areas not covered by dedicated leak sensors.,4,"Shows real leaks in unsensed areas with moisture/flow evidence; location-specific."
Leak sensor reliability assessment,"When flow anomalies and moisture spikes strongly co-occur but leak detection records are repeatedly missing for the same zone, the leak sensors there may be faulty, miscalibrated, or poorly positioned.",3,"Operational sensor reliability per zone; limited personal/behavior detail."
False leak detection spotting,Leak detection records that are not accompanied by any nearby flow anomaly or moisture increase are suspicious and may indicate false positives in the leak detector logic or hardware.,2,"Flags false leak records lacking corroboration; low privacy impact beyond timestamps."
Severity scoring of leak incidents,"For each incident where all three signals are present, integrating flow anomaly magnitude, peak moisture level, and leak duration yields a composite severity score for ranking leaks by damage potential.",4,"Per-incident severity integrating multiple signals and duration; enables detailed reconstruction."
Early warning pattern for developing leaks,Repeated small flow anomalies followed by subtle moisture increases that later culminate in recorded leaks define an early warning pattern for emerging leaks in that zone.,4,"Precursor patterns tied to zone and time; supports forecasting of future leaks."
Differentiating slow seepage from sudden bursts,"Incidents with long, low-level flow anomalies and gradually rising moisture that eventually trigger a leak record indicate slow seepage, while short, high flow spikes with rapid moisture jumps and quick leak detections indicate sudden bursts.",4,"Classifies severity and timing of bursts vs. seepage; detailed incident fingerprint."
Drainage and pooling diagnosis,"Incidents where the flow anomaly ends and leak detection stops but moisture remains elevated for a long time show poor drainage or water pooling, whereas fast moisture decay after leak resolution indicates good drainage.",3,"Post-incident moisture persistence reveals drainage quality; moderate sensitivity."
Estimating leaked volume from combined signals,"For leak incidents, integrating the flow anomaly over time and adjusting by the rate and duration of moisture elevation provides a more accurate estimate of leaked volume than any single signal alone.",4,"Quantifies leaked volume using timing and magnitude; supports incident reconstruction."
Localizing leak origin within a branch,"When a branch-level flow anomaly is followed first by moisture rise at a particular sensor and then by leak detections near that sensor, the earliest moisture increase helps pinpoint the likely origin of the leak.",5,"Pinpoints origin within a branch via earliest moisture; high location specificity."
Identifying multi-point leak events,A single sustained flow anomaly followed by moisture increases at multiple sensors and multiple leak detections in nearby zones indicates a multi-point leak event rather than a single localized failure.,4,"Multi-sensor spread across zones reveals layout and broader impact."
Characterizing self-resolving anomalies,"Flow anomalies that briefly appear but are not followed by elevated moisture or leak detections can be classified as self-resolving anomalies, likely caused by short-lived usage spikes or valve operations.",3,"Labels short anomalies without wet response as benign; moderate behavior visibility."
Determining anomaly criticality based on wet response,Flow anomalies that regularly produce significant moisture elevations and subsequent leak detections are more critical than anomalies of similar magnitude that never lead to moisture or leak records.,3,"Ranks anomalies by outcomes; moderate incident detail."
Detecting under-reported leaks,Zones where flow anomalies and sustained moisture peaks occur frequently but leak detection records are rare suggest under-reported leaks due to insufficient leak sensor coverage.,4,"Shows repeated leaks without detections in specific zones; location and history sensitive."
Validating moisture sensor placement using leak and flow data,"If leak detections and flow anomalies are concentrated in an area but moisture spikes are rarely observed, moisture sensors are likely mispositioned relative to where leaked water actually accumulates.",2,"Reveals sensor misplacement via missing moisture; low personal exposure."
Refining flow anomaly thresholds using leak and moisture outcomes,"By comparing flow anomaly magnitudes that consistently lead to both elevated moisture and leak detections with those that never affect either, thresholds can be tuned to focus on truly damaging anomalies.",2,"Threshold tuning from aggregated outcomes; limited personal detail."
Identifying leaks masked by normal usage,"In periods of high baseline consumption, small flow anomalies might be ambiguous, but when such anomalies still correlate with localized moisture increases and leak records, they reveal leaks hidden under normal usage noise.",3,"Finds leaks during high usage by correlating moisture/leak; links to occupancy periods."
Temporal ordering analysis for incident staging,"Studying the order in which flow anomalies begin, moisture rises, and leak detections are logged clarifies the staging of an incident—for example, whether sensors detect hydraulic changes before water becomes visible.",3,"Sequence analysis of signal timing; moderate incident specificity."
Chronic leak hotspot detection,"Locations that show recurring patterns of flow anomalies, repeated moisture elevations, and multiple leak detections over time can be labeled as chronic leak hotspots needing repair or redesign.",4,"Tags zones with recurring multi-signal leaks; strong location/history sensitivity."
Evaluating repair effectiveness via post-fix signal behavior,"After repairs in a hotspot, the reduction or disappearance of co-occurring flow anomalies, moisture spikes, and leak detections in that area indicates effective remediation, while continued tri-signal events suggest unresolved issues.",3,"Post-repair signal patterns reveal maintenance effectiveness; moderate timeline exposure."
Separating plumbing leaks from drainage backups,Incidents where moisture rises and leaks are detected but are not preceded by significant flow anomalies may indicate drainage or backflow issues rather than supply-side pipe leaks.,3,"Cause differentiation using signal presence; moderate incident information."
Classifying vertical vs. horizontal spread of leaks,"When a flow anomaly occurs and leak detections appear at one level while moisture subsequently rises at vertically offset sensors (e.g., below or above), the pattern reveals whether leakage is spreading vertically through building elements or horizontally across a floor.",4,"Propagation patterns expose layout and spread direction; location-sensitive."
Learning incident fingerprints for automated classification,"Over time, distinct combinations of flow anomaly shape, moisture evolution, and leak detection timing form fingerprints that can classify incidents into types such as burst pipe, slow joint leak, appliance overflow, or external ingress.",3,"Pattern library for classification; moderate incident detail without direct identity."
