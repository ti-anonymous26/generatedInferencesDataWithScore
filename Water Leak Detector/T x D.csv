Inference,Description,Score,Short rationale
Temperature-triggered vs. leak-triggered activations,"Device activations that occur when temperature crosses a configured threshold can be classified as temperature-triggered, while activations at stable, moderate temperatures are more likely leak-triggered or manual.",2,Mainly distinguishes control logic vs leak/manual events; weak but present link to manual behavior.
Freeze-risk alarm effectiveness,"If device activations consistently occur before pipes hit historically dangerous low temperatures, the freeze alarm strategy is effective.",1,"Evaluates how early alarms fire vs freeze risk; strategy quality, not user behavior."
Missed thermal intervention events,Periods where temperatures fall below a critical threshold without any device activation represent missed thermal interventions and silent thermal risks.,1,"Flags unprotected low-temp periods; structural risk signal, not personal."
Cooling or warming rate after thermal actions,"For temperature-driven device activations, the rate of temperature change after activation shows how effective the action is at raising or stabilizing pipe temperature.",1,Measures effect of actions on temperature; device/system performance only.
Effectiveness of emergency heating devices,"When a heating device activates in response to low temperatures, a subsequent rise or stabilization of temperature in that segment confirms the device is working.",1,"Confirms if emergency heating works; appliance state, not behavioral."
Avoided thermal damage (successful pre-emptive actions),Device activations that occur during rapid temperature drops and are followed by temperatures staying just above known freeze-damage levels indicate successful prevention of freeze damage.,2,Shows where pre-emptive protection worked; property-level damage avoidance.
Overly conservative thermal alerts,Frequent device activations at temperatures well above levels that have ever caused damage indicate overly conservative thermal thresholds.,1,"Threshold tuning/false positives; control config, no behavior."
Under-conservative thermal alerts,"If damage or leak episodes are associated with temperatures that were reached without any prior thermal device activation, alerts are not aggressive enough.",1,Alerts too lax vs damage; again control config.
Time-of-day dependence in thermal protection,"If low temperatures at night trigger fewer or later device activations than similar temperatures during the day, the system has time-of-day asymmetry in thermal protection.",2,Reveals that the system behaves differently at night vs day; mild inference about assumed occupancy patterns.
Manual vs. automatic thermal responses,"Device activations that consistently happen immediately as temperature crosses a precise threshold are likely automatic, while those happening later or at inconsistent temperatures are likely manual.",3,"Separates automatic threshold-based actions from delayed/manual ones, directly encoding human intervention times."
Detection of unnecessary thermal devices,"If devices frequently activate at specific temperatures but temperature trajectories look similar in incidents with and without those activations, those devices may not materially affect thermal conditions.",1,Identifies devices with little impact; design/optimization signal.
Locating thermally unprotected segments,Segments whose temperatures frequently drop to low levels without any device ever activating are thermally unprotected areas.,2,Highlights structurally vulnerable segments; tied to specific property zones.
Targeting insulation vs. active heating,"If temperature-related device activations are frequent and temperature still oscillates around low levels, insulation is inadequate and cannot be compensated by heating alone.",1,Indicates need for insulation vs heating; system/design choice more than behavior.
Overheating protection effectiveness,"For hot-water circuits, device activations that occur when temperature exceeds a safe limit and are followed by cooling back into a normal range show effective overheat protection.",1,"Confirms effective over-heat protection; safety feature behavior, not people."
Thermal cycling induced by control devices,"Repeated device activations that create regular temperature oscillations indicate that control logic is driving thermal cycling, which may stress materials.",1,Control-induced oscillations; control quality only.
Detecting control-loop instability,"If temperature fluctuates widely around a setpoint and device activations are rapid and frequent, the thermal control loop is unstable or poorly tuned.",1,Unstable control loop identification; purely technical.
Ranking devices by thermal impact,"By computing the average temperature change per activation for each device, the system can rank them by their thermal impact.",1,Average ΔT per activation per device; appliance effectiveness metric.
Identifying late activations relative to thermal risk,"For known thermal damage events, if device activations occur after temperatures remain below critical levels for a long time, they are classified as late activations.",1,"Classifies activations as “late”; still about control timing vs risk, not identity."
Correlating temperature exposure with activation frequency,Segments with long cumulative time below a low-temperature threshold and frequent temperature-related activations show that the system is working hard to protect them.,1,"Shows which segments need frequent protection; segment-level risk, not behavioral."
Inferring wrongly placed temperature sensors from activation patterns,"If thermal devices often activate yet local temperature sensors show only modest changes, sensors may not be placed close enough to the thermally affected pipe sections.",1,Sensor placement quality; structural/installation.
Protective shutdown vs. continuing thermal stress,"For devices that shut off flow to protect against freezing, if temperatures in the isolated segment continue to drop after shutdown, the segment remains thermally exposed.",1,Whether shutdown actually protects segment; structural risk only.
Thermal pre-conditioning before automatic actions,Some devices may activate only after temperature stays within a risky band for a certain duration; joint history reveals the implicit thermal pre-conditioning rule.,1,"Reveals implicit dwell-time rules in the controller; logic, not user."
Temperature-dependent escalation design,"If mild low temperatures trigger alerts while more extreme temperatures trigger alerts plus hardware actions, analyzing activation type and temperature shows a multi-level escalation design.",1,Shows multi-level escalation strategy; configuration insight.
Identifying non-thermal device activations,"Device activations that occur at completely normal, stable temperatures and do not correspond to any thermal trend are likely driven by non-thermal factors such as moisture, flow, or manual override.",3,"Explicitly surfaces actions driven by non-thermal factors (including manual overrides), giving a clearer picture of human/system decisions."
Learning safe thermal envelope from activation history,The range of temperatures where no thermal-related device activations occur and no damage is observed defines an empirically safe thermal envelope for that system.,1,Empirical safe range for that system; property-level engineering info.
