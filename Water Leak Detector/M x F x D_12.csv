Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Confirming true leak/moisture incidents via tri-signal agreement,Moisture rise accompanied by flow anomalies and device activation confirms a true water incident that required automatic intervention.,4,"Fully corroborated event with activation and timing; strong reconstruction potential."
Detecting device under-responsiveness,"If moisture rises and flow anomalies occur but devices do not activate, the system is failing to respond to real water incidents.",3,"Shows missed responses for specific incidents; moderate sensitivity."
Identifying nuisance moisture events,"Moisture spikes without flow anomalies or device activation suggest condensation, spills, or cleaning rather than plumbing failures.",3,"Separates benign moisture events; limited personal inference."
Assessing device activation thresholds using moisture–flow outcomes,"If moisture and flow anomalies regularly occur without device activation, the threshold for triggering devices may be set too high.",3,"Operational threshold tuning; moderate incident detail."
Detecting micro-leaks below device-trigger thresholds,Small flow anomalies and gradual moisture increases that never trigger device activation indicate micro-leaks undetectable by actuation logic.,4,"Captures subtle leaks with timing/location; incident-specific."
Evaluating effectiveness of device activation,Device activation followed by rapid moisture decay and reduced flow anomalies indicates successful mitigation of the water incident.,3,"Mitigation outcome per event; moderate exposure."
Identifying failed or insufficient device activation,"If moisture continues rising and flow anomalies persist after device activation, the device response is inadequate.",4,"Shows ineffective mitigation with timelines; incident-specific."
Distinguishing drainage issues from supply leaks,"Moisture rise without significant flow anomalies but with device activation (e.g., sump pump) suggests drainage failure instead of supply-side plumbing leaks.",3,"Identifies drainage vs. supply cause; moderate event sensitivity."
Predicting impending device activation from moisture–flow patterns,"Repeated small flow anomalies paired with incremental moisture rise often precede device activation, forming early warning signatures.",4,"Precursor patterns with activation timing; supports forecasting."
Identifying zones lacking adequate device coverage,"If moisture and flow anomalies frequently occur but device activation is rare, the zone lacks enough automated protection.",4,"Highlights under-protected zones; location-sensitive."
Temporal ordering for incident type classification,Moisture rise → flow anomaly → device activation indicates seepage; flow anomaly → moisture rise → activation indicates burst-like events.,4,"Sequence-based classification; strong incident fingerprint."
Device false activation detection,Device activation without matching moisture rise or flow anomalies suggests false triggers or malfunction.,2,"Flags false activations; low privacy impact."
Differentiating appliance discharge from leaks,Flow anomalies with warm temperatures but little moisture rise and no device activation indicate appliance discharge rather than leaks.,3,"Attributes events to appliances vs. leaks; some occupancy signal exposure."
Tri-signal severity scoring,"Combining moisture peak, flow anomaly magnitude, and device escalation level yields a severity index for prioritizing incidents.",4,"Severity scoring per incident; detailed but technical."
Detecting water pooling after device activation,"If device activation stops flow anomalies but moisture remains elevated for long periods, water pooling or inadequate drainage is occurring.",3,"Post-activation persistence; moderate sensitivity."
Leak propagation detection,"Sequential increases in moisture at multiple locations, aligned with flow anomalies and progressive device activations, indicate leak propagation.",5,"Propagation mapping across locations and activations; high location/timeline sensitivity."
Identifying intermittent leaks,Moisture and small flow anomalies that intermittently trigger device activation but self-resolve indicate cyclical or pressure-dependent leaks.,4,"Recurring subtle events with activation logs; incident-specific."
Validating moisture sensor accuracy via flow-device cross-check,"If devices activate due to flow anomalies but moisture does not rise, moisture sensors may be faulty or poorly positioned.",2,"Sensor diagnostic; low personal exposure."
Inferring concealed or underground leaks,Flow anomalies and device activations with delayed or minimal moisture rise indicate leaks occurring in concealed or underground areas.,5,"Hidden leak inference with location context; high reconstruction sensitivity."
Assessing time-to-mitigation,The time between moisture rise or flow anomaly onset and device activation quantifies mitigation latency.,3,"Mitigation latency per incident; moderate exposure."
Post-incident recovery analysis,"After device deactivation, monitoring moisture decay and flow normalization provides insight into recovery quality and remaining risks.",3,"Recovery timelines; moderate sensitivity."
Device workload profiling,Frequent device activations correlated with moisture and flow anomalies identify high-risk zones where additional preventive systems may be needed.,4,"Profiles high-workload zones; location/history sensitive."
Detecting degradation in device performance over time,"If increasing moisture levels or larger flow anomalies are required to trigger device activation, the device's sensitivity or responsiveness is degrading.",3,"Performance drift over time; moderate sensitivity."
Tri-signal incident fingerprinting,"Distinct patterns across moisture evolution, flow behavior, and activation timing classify incident types such as burst leak, slow seep, appliance overflow, or infiltration.",3,"Pattern library for classification; moderate incident detail."
Identifying cascading failures,"When an initial flow anomaly and moisture rise trigger one device, followed by additional device activations due to worsening moisture, it indicates cascading system failure under a single event.",4,"Cascade across devices and locations; high reconstruction potential."
