Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Confirming thermally-induced leak events,"When leak detection aligns with extreme temperature readings and immediate device activation, the event is confirmed as a thermally-induced leak, such as freeze-burst or overheating failure.",5,"Fully corroborated event with timing/location and activation; high reconstruction risk."
Filtering false leak detections using thermal and device inactivity,Leak detections occurring at normal temperatures and without device activation suggest false positives or sensor malfunction.,2,"Flags uncorroborated detections; low privacy impact."
Identifying freeze–thaw related bursts,"Rapid temperature rise from sub-freezing levels, followed by leak detection and device activation, indicates freeze–thaw pipe rupture.",4,"Freeze-thaw bursts with activation timing; event-specific."
Detecting overheating-induced seal failures,High pipe temperatures followed by leak detection and device activation identify leaks caused by overheated gaskets or seals.,4,"Overheat-related incidents with activation logs; strong incident specificity."
Assessing device responsiveness to thermal danger,"If device activation occurs only after leak detection during extreme temperatures, response is delayed; early activations before leak detection indicate proactive thermal protection.",3,"Operational timing metric; moderate privacy exposure via timestamps."
Distinguishing thermally benign leaks from thermally influenced leaks,"Leaks occurring at stable temperatures with late or no device activation reflect structurally benign failures, while leaks tied to temperature extremes reflect thermal-stress failures.",3,"Classifies cause with temperature/activation context; moderate incident detail."
Identifying leaks masked by thermal expansion,"High temperatures may temporarily expand pipes and reduce leakage, but device activation paired with leak detection during cooling indicates leaks reappearing after contraction.",4,"Shows temperature-dependent leak visibility with activation timing; event-specific."
Evaluating leak severity via temperature–activation correlation,Leaks accompanied by extreme temperatures and rapid multi-device activation are classified as high-severity thermal failures.,4,"Severity grading with activation timeline; strong reconstruction potential."
Understanding leak onset timing from thermal slope,A temperature drop or spike preceding leak detection and device activation indicates that thermal stress triggered the leak before water loss became detectable.,3,"Sequence inference; moderate incident specificity."
Detecting delayed leak manifestation after thermal events,Temperature extremes occurring hours before leak detection and device activation indicate delayed structural failure caused by accumulated thermal fatigue.,4,"Delayed failure mapping with timelines; reconstruction-sensitive."
Verifying thermal-protection device performance,"If thermal protection devices activate early during temperature drops and prevent leak detection, they are effective; leaks occurring despite activation indicate underperformance.",2,"Device performance check; low personal exposure."
Differentiating thermal condensation events from leaks,Cool temperatures may cause condensation; moisture-free leak detections with device activation are suspicious unless temperatures indicate structural failure likelihood.,3,"Distinguishes condensation vs. leak using temperature and activation; moderate sensitivity."
Thermal-risk-based prioritization of leak alerts,Leaks occurring near thermal thresholds and triggering immediate device activation are prioritized over leaks occurring under mild temperatures.,3,"Prioritization logic with thresholds and activation; limited personal detail."
Identifying temperature-insensitive leak sensors,"If leak sensors fail to detect leaks during extreme temperatures but devices activate due to pressure or moisture cues, leak sensors may be insensitive in thermal extremes.",2,"Sensor sensitivity diagnostic; low privacy impact."
Assessing post-repair thermal resilience,"If leak detections reoccur only during temperature extremes and trigger device activations, repairs were insufficient against thermal stress.",3,"Post-repair status under thermal stress; moderate timeline/location exposure."

Predicting future leaks using thermal cycles,"Repeating cycles of temperature extremes followed by leak detections and device activation indicate recurring thermal fatigue, predicting future leak sites.",4,"Recurring pattern forecasting; location and timeline sensitive."
Evaluating building zone insulation quality,Leaks that repeatedly occur during extreme temperatures and require device activation show insufficient insulation in that region.,4,"Maps zones needing insulation; location/history sensitivity."
Thermal dependence of leak propagation speed,"High temperatures may cause rapid propagation of leak severity requiring faster device activation, while cold temperatures may slow leak evolution.",3,"Analyzes propagation vs. temperature; moderate incident detail."
Distinguishing rapid thermal-failure bursts from gradual failures,"Rapid temperature swings preceding leak detection and instant device activation indicate bursts, while slow temperature drifts with delayed activation indicate gradual failures.",3,"Classifies burst vs. gradual with timing; moderate reconstruction risk."
Proactive vs. reactive thermal response classification,Device activations that occur before leak detections during severe temperature changes reflect proactive control; ones that follow leak detection reflect reactive response.,3,"Response classification using timing; moderate sensitivity."
Validating leak resolution through temperature normalization,"A leak is confirmed resolved when devices deactivate, leak logs clear, and temperature readings return to normal ranges without further anomalies.",2,"Resolution check; low privacy impact."
Tri-signal characterization of rare thermal anomalies,Leak detection + unique thermal signature + device escalation identifies rare events such as localized overheating or freeze pockets not captured by single-signal analysis.,3,"Identifies rare events with thermal/device context; moderate incident detail."
