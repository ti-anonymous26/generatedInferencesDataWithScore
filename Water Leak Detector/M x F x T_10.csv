Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Confirming true water presence via tri-signal agreement,"When moisture rises, flow anomalies occur, and temperatures shift simultaneously, the system can confirm the presence of actual water movement rather than sensor noise.",4,"Triangulated incident confirmation; strong reconstruction potential."
Distinguishing condensation from plumbing leaks,"Moisture increases at low temperatures without corresponding flow anomalies indicate condensation, whereas moisture plus flow anomalies confirms plumbing leaks.",3,"Separates condensation vs. leaks; moderate context sensitivity."
Identifying freeze-induced partial blockages,Low temperatures with reduced flow anomalies and rising moisture indicate partial ice blockage causing seepage rather than full pipe rupture.,3,"Freeze-related partial blockage signals; moderate incident specificity."
Detecting freeze–thaw seepage precursors,Sustained sub-freezing temperatures followed by small flow anomalies and early moisture rise represent precursors to freeze-induced leaks.,4,"Precursors tied to temperature and timing; reconstruction risk."
Classifying burst vs. seep leaks using flow–moisture dynamics,"High flow anomalies with rapid moisture rise and temperature extremes indicate burst leaks, while small anomalies with gradual moisture increase imply seepage.",4,"Classifies severity/type with timing; strong incident fingerprint."
Estimating leak rate using flow–moisture patterns under temperature effects,"Combining flow anomaly magnitude, moisture accumulation rate, and thermal context improves estimation of leak severity and progression.",4,"Quantifies severity with temperature context; detailed reconstruction."
Identifying non-plumbing water ingress,"Moisture spikes without flow anomalies at normal temperatures suggest external ingress such as rainfall, drainage failure, or spills.",3,"External ingress identification; moderate location/timing sensitivity."
Evaluating insulation effectiveness through thermal–moisture correlation,Zones showing moisture rise and flow anomalies only during temperature extremes reveal insulation weaknesses.,4,"Maps insulation gaps by zone; location/history sensitive."
Detecting leaks masked in high-demand periods,Small flow anomalies hidden under large baseline usage can still be detected when temperature anomalies and moisture increases align.,3,"Finds leaks during high usage; moderate sensitivity."
Assessing cold-weather risk zones,Moisture elevation and flow anomalies repeatedly occurring at low temperatures identify cold-sensitive plumbing areas.,4,"Cold-risk zones with multi-signal evidence; location-sensitive."
Ranking zones by thermal sensitivity to leaks,Zones where leaks consistently occur alongside temperature extremes and moisture rise can be classified as thermally vulnerable.,3,"Zone vulnerability ranking; moderate location exposure."
Differentiating high-viscosity flow behavior in cold conditions,Cold temperatures reduce flow rates; small flow anomalies paired with significant moisture rise indicate restricted but ongoing leakage.,2,"Analytical behavior; low incident specificity."
Detecting overheating-related leaks,Elevated temperatures paired with flow anomalies and moisture rise reveal overheating-induced seal or pipe failures.,3,"Overheat leak identification; incident-specific but limited personal inference."
Analyzing temperature-dependent moisture spread rates,Moisture tends to spread faster at higher temperatures; slow spread despite flow anomalies indicates cooler ambient conditions.,2,"Propagation analysis; low privacy impact."
Identifying stagnant-pooling events,Moisture rise without matching flow anomaly magnitude at stable temperatures suggests water pooling due to insufficient drainage.,3,"Pooling detection; moderate sensitivity."
Recognizing appliance-related anomalies,Flow anomalies with high temperatures but transient moisture indicate appliance discharge rather than structural leaks.,3,"Attributes events to appliances; some occupancy signal exposure."
Inferring leak location using temperature gradients and moisture timing,The earliest moisture rise and strongest temperature deviation during a flow anomaly help pinpoint the leak source.,5,"Pinpoints leak source via gradients/timing; high location sensitivity."
Detecting hidden leaks behind insulated surfaces,Moisture rise plus flow anomalies but minimal temperature deviation implies leaks behind insulated walls or underground.,4,"Hidden leak inference; location-specific."
Validating flow sensor accuracy using moisture–temperature feedback,Repeated moisture and temperature anomalies without flow anomaly detection suggest faulty or insensitive flow sensors.,2,"Sensor diagnostic; low privacy exposure."
Characterizing multi-factor leak severity progression,"Severe leaks show combined signatures of large flow anomalies, rapid moisture accumulation, and strong thermal shifts.",4,"Severity profiling with multi-signals; detailed reconstruction."
Predicting leak escalation using tri-signal trends,Gradual temperature drift plus small flow anomalies and slowly rising moisture can signal an impending escalation into a major leak.,4,"Early-warning trends with timing; moderate-to-high sensitivity."
Thermal profiling for leak type classification,"Different leak types—freeze leaks, hot-water leaks, structural seepage—create distinct temperature–flow–moisture profiles.",3,"Pattern library for classification; moderate incident detail."
Identifying leaks suppressed by temperature effects,Cold temperatures may temporarily reduce observable flow but moisture rise still reveals ongoing leakage.,3,"Notes ongoing leaks masked by cold; moderate sensitivity."
Detecting drainage or backflow issues,Moisture rise at stable temperatures without proportional flow anomalies may indicate drainage obstruction rather than supply-side pipe leaks.,3,"Cause differentiation; moderate incident detail."
Learning leak fingerprints from tri-signal interactions,"Each incident forms a pattern of temperature slope, moisture evolution, and flow anomaly shape, enabling machine-learned classification of leak types.",3,"Pattern library; moderate sensitivity."
