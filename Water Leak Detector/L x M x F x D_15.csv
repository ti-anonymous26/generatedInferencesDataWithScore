Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Quadruple-confirmed actionable leak event,"When leak detection, moisture rise, flow anomalies, and device activation occur together, the event is validated across all sensing and actuation layers, indicating a fully confirmed active leak.",5,"Fully detailed incident with timing, location, and mitigation actions; high reconstruction and profiling risk."
Detecting unmitigated leak events,Leak detections with matching moisture and flow anomalies but without device activation indicate failures in automatic mitigation or insufficient device coverage.,4,"Shows confirmed leaks lacking response; event-specific with location and timing."
Identifying false leak detections using moisture–flow–device cross-validation,"Leak detection entries not accompanied by flow anomalies, moisture rise, or device activation suggest sensor-level false positives.",2,"Flags false alarms; low personal inference beyond detection timestamps."
Detecting concealed leaks missed by leak sensors,Flow anomalies and moisture elevation paired with device activation but without leak detection entries indicate leaks occurring in areas not covered or detected by leak sensors.,4,"Reveals real leaks and locations outside sensor coverage; event-specific."
Assessing device responsiveness to real leaks,"If device activation lags significantly behind simultaneous leak detection, moisture rise, and flow anomalies, the automation response is delayed and poses higher damage risk.",3,"Operational timing during confirmed events; moderate privacy exposure."
Distinguishing nuisance moisture events from true leaks,Moisture increases without flow anomalies or leak detections but with occasional device activation may represent false triggers; true leaks show consistent alignment among all four signals.,3,"Separates benign moisture from leaks; moderate incident detail."
Leak severity scoring using multi-signal intensity,"Combining flow anomaly magnitude, moisture accumulation rate, leak detection duration, and escalation level of device activation provides a composite severity index.",4,"Per-incident severity score across multiple signals; supports detailed reconstruction."
Identifying micro-leaks undetected by leak sensors,Small flow anomalies and slowly rising moisture that trigger device activation without leak detection reveal micro-leaks below detector sensitivity.,4,"Captures subtle, repeated leaks with activation logs; location/timing sensitive."
Detecting progressive leak escalation,"An increasing pattern of flow anomalies, sustained moisture rise, and repeated device activations following an initial leak detection indicates leak escalation.",5,"Escalation timelines and repeated activations give rich incident history."
Evaluating repair effectiveness through multi-signal suppression,"A successful repair is indicated when post-repair periods show no co-occurrence of moisture rise, flow anomalies, leak detections, or device activations.",3,"Post-repair status over time; moderate sensitivity about maintenance history."
Classifying slow seepage vs. sudden rupture leaks,"Slow seepage shows gradual moisture rise with small flow anomalies and delayed device activation, while rupture leaks show abrupt flow spikes, rapid moisture accumulation, and immediate activation.",4,"Severity/type classification with timelines; detailed incident fingerprint."
Identifying leaks hidden during high-demand periods,"During peak usage, small flow anomalies signaling leaks may be hidden, but matching moisture rise, leak detection, and device activation reveal the event.",4,"Finds leaks amid high usage, linking events to occupancy patterns and zones."
Determining leak location using activation order and moisture spread,The order in which moisture sensors rise and devices activate relative to flow anomalies and leak detection helps triangulate leak origin.,5,"Activation order and moisture spread pinpoint origin and propagation; high location sensitivity."
Detecting drainage or backflow problems,Moisture rise and device activation without corresponding flow anomalies or leak detections suggest drainage or backflow issues instead of supply-side leaks.,3,"Identifies non-supply issues; moderate event detail."
Temporal fingerprinting for leak classification,"Distinct event sequences such as flow anomaly → moisture rise → leak detection → device activation form fingerprints for burst leaks, whereas moisture → delayed flow → leak detection → activation signals slow seepage.",3,"Sequence patterns for classification; moderate sensitivity."
Identifying worsening leaks despite mitigation,"If device activation reduces but does not eliminate flow anomalies and moisture levels continue rising, the leak persists or worsens despite mitigation.",4,"Shows worsening incidents and mitigation gaps over time; event-specific."
Pressure-driven leak identification,Flow anomalies occurring before moisture rise and leak detection indicate pressure-related leaks that are detected hydraulically before water becomes visible.,3,"Cause classification via signal order; limited personal inference."
Surface pooling detection after leak events,"If leak detection ends and device activation stops but moisture stays elevated, water remains pooled due to insufficient drainage.",3,"Post-incident moisture lingering; moderate reconstruction detail."
Detecting intermittent leaks through multi-signal recurrence,"Repeated cycles of small moisture rises, flow anomalies, and periodic device activation without continuous leak detection indicate intermittent leaks.",4,"Recurring event patterns with activations; reveals timing and zones."
Localizing leaks in multi-story or multi-zone setups,"If flow anomalies and leak detections appear in one zone while moisture rises first in another and device activation cascades, the system can infer vertical or lateral propagation.",5,"Propagation mapping across zones; high location/timeline sensitivity."
Identifying false device activations,"Device activation unaccompanied by flow anomalies, leak detection, or moisture rise suggests false triggers from control or hardware malfunction.",2,"Isolated false activations; low privacy impact beyond activation timestamp."
Assessing moisture sensor coverage using leak-flow-device signals,"If leak and flow anomalies occur with device activation but moisture remains static, moisture sensors may be misplaced or malfunctioning.",3,"Highlights coverage gaps; moderate event context."
Learning zone-specific leak signatures,"Each zone develops characteristic patterns involving moisture shape, flow anomaly behavior, device activation count, and timing of leak detection, enabling machine learning classification.",4,"Zone-level pattern library over time; embeds history and layout."
Prioritizing high-risk leak events,"Events with large flow anomalies, steep moisture rise, rapid leak detection, and escalated device activation are high-severity leaks needing urgent intervention.",4,"High-severity incident profiling with timelines and actions."
Identifying cascading system failures,"A leak that triggers multiple flow anomalies, widespread moisture rise, and sequential device activations indicates cascading infrastructure failure.",4,"Multi-stage cascade across zones and activations; detailed incident reconstruction."
