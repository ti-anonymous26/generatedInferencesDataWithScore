Inference,Description,Score,Short rationale
Detection-to-alert latency,"For each leak, the time between leak detection and first device activation measures how quickly the system converts a detected leak into an alert or action.",2,Mostly measures system responsiveness; weak indirect link to whether humans ever see/act on alerts.
Alert-to-leak-resolution latency,The time between first device activation and the last leak detection record for that incident estimates how long the leak remained active after being flagged.,3,"Tightly tied to how long users (or operators) take to fix issues after alerts, i.e., response behavior."
Unalerted leak events,Leak events in history that have no corresponding device activation in a reasonable time window are unalerted leaks and indicate alert-layer failure.,1,"Indicates alert-layer failure; structural/system quality, not user behavior."
False alerts (device activations without leaks),Device activations that occur without any leak recorded around the same time and location indicate false or test alerts rather than true incidents.,1,"Identifies false or test alerts; about configuration/noise, not people."
Incident lifecycle reconstruction,"Combining leak history with device activation history reconstructs a full incident timeline: when the leak started, when alerts fired, and when it was resolved.",2,Builds full incident timelines; can indirectly reveal when humans intervene but is mainly structural incident metadata.
Effectiveness of automatic shutoff,"For leaks where a shutoff device activates, a sharp reduction or cessation of subsequent leak records shows that automatic shutoff is effective.",1,Device performance during leaks; no behavioral dimension.
User vs. automation response classification,"Very short detection-to-activation intervals suggest automated actions, while longer and more variable intervals indicate manual user responses.",3,"Explicitly separates automatic vs manual actions, exposing patterns of human response timing."
User responsiveness profile,Comparing alert activation times with the times leaks stop provides a measure of how quickly users typically react to leak alerts.,3,Direct metric for how quickly users typically act on alerts to stop leaks.
Multi-alert escalation effectiveness,Leaks that only stop after multiple device activations show that a single alert is insufficient and that escalation helps drive mitigation.,1,"Evaluates escalation logic; technical, not personal."
Over-alerting and alert fatigue risk,"If many device activations correspond to small, short-lived leaks, the system may be over-alerting, increasing the risk that users begin to ignore alerts.",1,Shows that small leaks trigger many alerts; doesn’t itself encode user behavior.
Prioritization of zones by unmitigated leak time,"Summing leak durations in which there was no or very delayed device activation yields unmitigated leak time per zone, highlighting where mitigation is weakest.",2,"Highlights zones where leaks stay unmitigated; zone-level risk and policy, mild behavior signal."
Coverage gaps in device placement,Locations with many leaks but few or no device activations indicate poor coverage by alarms or actuators in those areas.,2,Reveals which locations are under-instrumented; property layout/policy info.
Over-instrumented low-risk zones,Zones with many device activations but very few leaks suggest over-instrumentation or overly sensitive triggers.,1,Zones with many alerts but few leaks; about design/tuning.
Leak severity vs. alert behavior alignment,Severe leaks that receive only minimal or delayed device activations reveal misalignment between incident severity and the strength or speed of alerting.,2,"Shows misalignment between severity and response; mostly system configuration, not identity."
Distinguishing tests from real incidents,Device activations that recur at regular intervals and never coincide with leak entries can be identified as system tests rather than real leak events.,2,Regular test patterns expose maintenance/ops schedules (weak temporal behavior signal).
Incident recurrence after resolution,"If leak history shows a new leak at the same location soon after device activation marked resolution, the underlying problem was not fully fixed.",1,Indicates incomplete fixes; maintenance quality only.
Ranking devices by real-incident impact,"Devices whose activations are frequently followed by leak termination are more impactful, while those that rarely precede resolution may be less effective or misused.",1,Device effectiveness metric; no behavioral info.
Optimizing alert timing from historical patterns,"By comparing detection times, activation times, and leak durations, the system can learn optimal alert timing for different leak patterns to minimize damage.",1,Uses history to tune alert timing; system-level.
Single-leak vs. multi-leak incident discrimination,"If one device activation corresponds to multiple leak events in a short window, the system may be grouping multiple leaks as one broader incident.",1,Classifies event grouping; structural metadata.
Missed leak escalation opportunities,Leaks that last long or recur without triggering escalated device actions highlight where additional or stronger alerts should have been used.,1,Shows where escalation should have happened; policy/design issue.
Temporal patterns of leak–alert correlation,"Leaks occurring at certain times of day may show longer detection-to-alert or alert-to-resolution gaps, indicating time-dependent differences in user availability.",2,"Time-of-day patterns (e.g., slower response at night) give mild info about user availability/attention."
Validating leak detector accuracy via alert consistency,Leak sensors that often produce leak events without any associated device activation may be mis-integrated into the alerting logic.,1,Flags mis-integrated sensors; technical integration.
Device malfunction detection using leak outcomes,"If device activations occur during leaks but leak records do not shorten or cease afterward, the corresponding device may be malfunctioning or improperly installed.",1,Detects malfunctioning devices; no user behavior.
Proactive vs. reactive protection split,"Some device activations may occur before any leak history entries and later correlate with fewer or milder leaks, indicating effective proactive protection.",1,Distinguishes pre-emptive from reactive device actions; system behavior only.
Determining silent leak tolerance,The longest leak duration in history that occurred without any device activation represents the system’s current tolerance for silent leaks.,1,"Longest unalerted leak duration; global risk tolerance metric, not personal."
Alignment between incident classification and device response,"If leaks classified as critical receive the same device response as minor leaks, the system is not using severity information to modulate alert strength.",1,Checks if severity labels affect response; policy-level.
Location-aware policy gaps,"Comparing high-value or sensitive locations in leak history with their device activation patterns reveals whether they receive preferential, faster, or stronger responses.",2,"Reveals whether high-value/sensitive locations get preferential protection; location/policy, not per-person."
Impact of configuration changes over time,"Before and after rule or configuration changes, shifts in the ratio of leaks with timely device activations and average leak duration reveal the impact of those changes.",1,Before/after config change impact; admin/system metric.
Multi-device coordination effectiveness,"Leaks that end faster when multiple devices activate together, compared to single-device responses, demonstrate the value of coordinated multi-device mitigation.",1,Compares single vs multi-device responses; technical only.
Inferring user override behavior,"If device activations such as automatic shutoff occur but leak records show continuity or quick recurrence, users may be overriding or bypassing protection mechanisms.",3,Directly reveals cases where users bypass or override protection (a clear behavioral/attitude signal).
