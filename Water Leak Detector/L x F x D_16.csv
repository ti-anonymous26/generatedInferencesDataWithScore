Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Validating true leak events through action-response alignment,"A leak detection accompanied by a flow anomaly and immediate device activation confirms a true leak, as both hydraulic changes and system response align.",4,"Event-level confirmation with timing and activation reveals specific incidents and responses."
Detecting leaks masked during high usage periods,Small leaks during heavy water use can be identified when leak detection logs and device activations occur even though flow anomalies appear subtle.,4,"Uncovers leaks during occupancy peaks; links device actions to usage patterns and locations."
Identifying device non-responsiveness during confirmed leaks,"If leak detection and flow anomalies occur but device activation is absent, the device failed to respond to a confirmed leak event.",3,"Shows missed responses for specific leak events; moderate incident detail without deep behavior profiling."
Prioritizing severe leaks from flow-activation dynamics,High-magnitude flow anomalies paired with fast device activation after leak detection indicate severe leaks requiring urgent intervention.,4,"Severity and rapid activation tie to high-impact events; strong reconstruction potential."
Filtering false leak detections using flow and device inactivity,Leak detections without flow anomalies and without device activation suggest false positives or faulty leak sensors.,3,"Identifies false alarms with timestamps; limited personal inference beyond event logs."
Determining leak onset sequence for classification,Analyzing whether flow anomalies or leak detection occur first before device activation helps classify leaks as burst-type or seep-type.,4,"Ordering signals provides detailed incident fingerprint and timing."
Evaluating device activation speed relative to flow change,"Comparing flow anomaly onset to device activation time reveals if devices respond promptly, late, or prematurely.",2,"Operational performance metric; low direct privacy impact beyond event timing."
Recognizing pre-leak flow anomaly patterns,Repeated small flow anomalies followed by leak detection and device activation form early-warning signatures for emerging leaks.,4,"Early-warning patterns reveal recurring stress points and timelines for specific zones."
Localizing leak severity via flow decay after activation,"If device activation reduces flow anomaly magnitude quickly, the leak is controlled; persistent high flow after activation indicates major leakage.",4,"Tracks severity and control effectiveness per incident; reveals timing and zone."
Identifying unnecessary device activations,Device activation without corresponding flow anomalies or leak detections suggests excessive sensitivity or misconfiguration.,2,"Highlights false activations; minimal behavioral exposure aside from activation timestamps."
Classifying multi-point leak events,Simultaneous flow anomalies across zones combined with multiple device activations and leak detections indicate distributed or multi-point leak incidents.,5,"Multi-zone events with activation order expose spatial layout and detailed incident spread."
Detecting micro-leaks from subtle flow shifts and delayed detection,Small flow anomalies with delayed leak detection but eventual device activation suggest micro-leaks below standard detection thresholds.,4,"Captures subtle, repeated issues with activation timelines; moderate-to-high incident specificity."
Evaluating leak sensor placement via tri-signal gaps,"If consistent flow anomalies and device activations occur without leak detection, sensors may be poorly placed relative to the leak origin.",3,"Reveals where leaks occur without detection, implying location gaps; moderate sensitivity."
Confirming incident resolution using flow-device synchrony,A leak is truly resolved when flow anomalies stop and devices deactivate shortly after leak detection ends; discrepancies indicate incomplete resolution.,3,"Resolution timelines per incident; limited occupant inference but event-specific."
Assessing repair durability through post-repair tri-signal monitoring,"If flow anomalies reappear after repairs and trigger leak detection and device activation, the repair is ineffective or another failure has occurred.",4,"Shows repair history and recurrence with activations; ties events to maintenance timeline."
Distinguishing plumbing leaks from appliance-related anomalies,Flow anomalies paired with leak detection and device activation during appliance cycles may indicate appliance failure rather than pipe leaks.,4,"Attributes events to appliance use, exposing occupant activity and timing."
Temporal fingerprinting for automated leak classification,Different leak types create distinct sequences such as flow anomaly → leak detection → activation (burst) or leak detection → activation → flow change (structural seep).,3,"Sequence patterns used for classification; moderate detail without full identity exposure."
Detecting intermittent or self-healing leaks,Flow anomalies and occasional leak detections that trigger device activation but self-resolve indicate intermittent leaks due to fluctuating pressure or loose fittings.,4,"Recurring events with activation logs reveal timing and persistence of hidden issues."
Identifying concealed leaks via device-driven signal amplification,"Device activations during subtle flow anomalies and minor leak detections amplify the signal, suggesting concealed leaks behind walls or underground.",4,"Combines subtle anomalies with activations to infer hidden locations; incident-specific."
Recognizing leak escalation events,Flow anomaly growth after leak detection and during active device response indicates leaks that are worsening despite mitigation attempts.,4,"Escalation tracking shows worsening incidents over time; strong reconstruction potential."
Validating device effectiveness through flow suppression patterns,Effective devices show reduced flow anomaly levels soon after activation; lack of reduction indicates partial or complete failure.,3,"Evaluates mitigation per incident; moderate sensitivity via activation and flow timelines."
Understanding failure chains from tri-signal staging,"A pattern of flow anomaly → delayed leak detection → delayed activation suggests a slow detection chain, increasing damage risk.",4,"Chronological staging of signals exposes detection lag and incident evolution."
Inferring leak location through activation order,"When multiple devices activate sequentially after a flow anomaly and leak detection, the activation order can reveal the spread direction or closest control point.",4,"Activation sequence reveals spatial path and control points; event-specific location insight."
Disambiguating structural moisture issues from leaks,"If leak detections and device activations occur without corresponding flow anomalies, the cause may be ingress or structural issues rather than plumbing leaks.",3,"Identifies non-plumbing causes with event timing; moderate privacy exposure."
Creating severity indices using combined signal strength,"Leak severity can be scored by integrating flow anomaly magnitude, leak detection duration, and device activation escalation levels.",4,"Severity scoring per event across multiple signals enables detailed reconstruction and prioritization."
