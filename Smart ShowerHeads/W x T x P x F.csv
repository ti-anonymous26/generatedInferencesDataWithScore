inference,Description,score,short rationale
Hot-water leak with no user present,"Flow anomaly alert fires while flow rate history shows sustained non-zero flow, temperature stays significantly above cold baseline, and proximity sensors report no recent activations, indicating a likely unattended hot-water leak rather than user-driven use.",4,"Warm flow with no presence exposes unattended hot leaks and absence windows."
Cold-line leak with no user present,"Anomaly alert coincides with low to moderate continuous flow in the history, temperature trends remain near ambient, and proximity shows no presence, suggesting a cold-line or mixed-line leak that wastes water but not much energy.",3,"Cold leak during absence; moderate privacy impact."
Scalding-risk anomaly under active user exposure,"During an anomaly alert, flow rate is high, temperature exceeds a scald threshold, and proximity indicates a person is in front of the fixture, revealing a scalding-risk event that directly affects the user instead of a harmless hot spike when no one is present.",4,"Directly ties scalding hazard to a present user."
Cold-shock anomaly experienced by user,"A flow anomaly alert marks a sudden change in flow conditions while temperature abruptly drops far below the recent comfort range and proximity remains active, indicating a cold-shock event the user actually experiences mid-use.",4,"Captures cold-shock experienced by a user."
Hot-side burst event with user nearby,"Flow history shows a short, high-intensity spike, temperature jumps up, an anomaly alert is triggered, and proximity detects a user at the same time, suggesting a hot-side burst or sudden valve opening while someone is close to the outlet.",4,"Links burst event to nearby user presence."
Water hammer / pressure shock localization by line type,"Very short anomaly alerts with sharp flow spikes and transient temperature jitter that occur while proximity shows presence can be tagged as water hammer events, classified as hot-side, cold-side, or mixed depending on the dominant temperature during the spike.",2,"Physical shock classification with limited personal data."
Energy waste estimation for unattended hot anomalies,"For anomaly alerts with sustained warm temperatures, continuous abnormal flow, and no proximity activations, integrate flow over the alert window and multiply by thermal rise above baseline to estimate energy wasted by hot water running without anyone present.",3,"Quantifies unattended hot waste, implying absence."
Detection of valves reopening after user leaves,"After proximity disappears and no user is near, an anomaly alert fires while flow history shows renewed flow and temperature returns to previous levels, indicating a valve that intermittently reopens on its own once users have departed.",4,"Shows unintended flow restarting post-departure."
Thermostatic control instability only under abnormal flow,"During anomaly alerts with unusual flow patterns, temperature trends start oscillating around the setpoint while proximity confirms someone is present; this indicates thermostatic control instability that appears only under abnormal hydraulic conditions.",3,"Reveals instability during user-present anomalies."
Leak triggered by high-demand usage,"Following a period of intense flow and elevated temperatures with active proximity (suggesting heavy usage), a flow anomaly alert occurs with persistent warm flow after proximity disappears; this suggests that high-demand events trigger post-use leaks.",3,"Ties post-use leaks to specific heavy-usage periods."
Thermal footprint mapping of leak locations,"Repeated anomaly alerts with similar flow magnitudes, similar temperature plateaus, and no proximity, clustered in time or device ID, allow mapping where in the system leaks occur and whether they are primarily hot or cold based on their thermal signature.",2,"Leak location mapping with minimal personal exposure."
Transient anomaly vs persistent fault classification,An anomaly alert where flow and temperature both quickly return to normal signature patterns and no additional proximity appears is classified as a transient system state; repeated alerts with similar flow–temperature–presence combinations indicate persistent faults.,2,"Fault persistence check; limited behavioral detail."
Seasonal variation of user-present hot anomalies,Compare anomaly events that occur during active proximity across seasons; clusters of high-temperature anomalies with users present in winter and more lukewarm anomalies in summer indicate how seasonal heating demands interact with user behavior to cause abnormal events.,2,"Seasonal trend with coarse behavior insight."
Presence-aware anomaly severity ranking,"Rank anomaly alerts using flow magnitude, temperature deviation, and presence: events with large abnormal flow, extreme temperature, and active proximity receive highest severity; those with mild flow deviation, mild temperature change, and no presence are lowest.",3,"Severity ranking using presence context."
Detection of child-associated dangerous anomalies,"If proximity sensors support height or zone discrimination, anomaly alerts with very hot or very cold temperatures that coincide with lower-height presence patterns can be interpreted as child-associated risky events, even without explicit identity data.",5,"Infers child presence during dangerous temperature events."
Idle overheating with user investigation but no usage,"An anomaly alert shows rising temperature with small flow disturbance, proximity detects brief user presence, but no regular flow pattern appears; this suggests users are checking a suspiciously hot fixture without committing to full use.",3,"Shows user investigation around idle overheating."
Anomaly-triggered user intervention detection,"During an anomaly alert window, a surge in proximity activity followed by rapid normalization of temperature and flow indicates that users responded to visible abnormal behavior and intervened to stop or correct the problem.",3,"Captures user response timing to anomalies."
Chronic low-flow warm seepage detection,"Multiple anomaly alerts over time show slightly elevated temperatures and low but non-zero flows, all occurring without proximity; this pattern reveals chronic warm seepage that slowly wastes energy and water but is unlikely to be noticed by occupants.",3,"Identifies unattended warm seepage during absence."
Differentiating warm recirculation faults from real leaks,Anomalies with small repetitive flow pulses at warm temperature and no proximity may be due to misbehaving recirculation pumps; anomalies with more continuous warm flow and longer durations are more likely actual leaks.,2,"Separates recirculation faults from true leaks; low personal risk."
Time-of-day risk profiling for unattended anomalies,"By combining anomaly timestamps with typical proximity patterns and absence of regular flow, the system can determine which times of day (e.g., late night) carry higher risk of unattended leaks or hot anomalies when nobody is around.",3,"Profiles high-risk absent windows by time."
Temperature overshoot during high-flow anomalies with presence,"When anomaly alerts mark very high flow rates and temperature trends show overshoot above normal comfort levels while proximity indicates a user is present, the system can tag such events as control-loop failures under extreme demand that impact user comfort and safety.",4,"Links control overshoot to present users."
Cold-line contamination or backflow during anomalies,"Anomaly alerts where temperature unexpectedly rises above typical cold baseline yet not into comfort or hot ranges, combined with modest abnormal flow and possibly brief proximity, indicate potential cross-connection or backflow issues rather than pure leaks.",2,"Technical issue classification; limited personal data."
Thermal shock avoidance behavior during anomalies,"If, during anomaly alerts with rapid temperature changes, proximity data shows users quickly moving away or becoming absent while flow remains abnormal, it suggests behavioral avoidance of thermal shock even when water continues to flow.",3,"Shows avoidance behavior and timing."
Fixture-level resiliency scoring under abnormal conditions,"For each fixture, analyze anomaly events that coincide with presence and flow changes, and measure how quickly temperature returns to normal; shorter recovery times during similar anomalies mean higher resiliency scores for that fixture.",2,"Resiliency scoring with modest behavioral content."
Detection of valves that only leak under hot conditions,"Anomaly alerts with abnormal flow that occur primarily when temperature is high and no proximity is detected indicate valves that seal correctly when cold but leak when exposed to hot water, due to thermal expansion or material fatigue.",3,"Identifies leaks dependent on hot conditions during absence."
Differentiation between short high-temperature tests and long leaks,"Combine anomaly duration, temperature level, and proximity: short anomalies with brief presence and high temperature spikes suggest intentional tests, while long anomalies with no presence and stable warm temperatures indicate leaks.",3,"Separates intentional hot tests from unattended leaks."
Predictive identification of high-risk hot-leak windows,"Analyze historical hot-water leak anomalies (warm flow, no presence) together with temperature and system states to identify patterns; when similar temperature baselines and schedules recur, the system can label those future periods as high-risk windows for hot leaks.",4,"Predicts future hot leaks during known absence patterns."
Detection of gradually worsening hot-side failures,"Track the evolution of anomaly alerts that exhibit slowly increasing warm flow volumes without proximity; a monotonic increase suggests progressively worsening hot-side failures, such as deteriorating seals or joints, before catastrophic failure.",3,"Shows worsening hot-side fault during absence."
Context-aware escalation for anomalies near typical shower times,"During periods historically associated with showers (from usage logs in a broader system), anomaly alerts with extreme temperature and active proximity are more likely to disturb user comfort and should be escalated more than similar events at times rarely used for washing.",4,"Elevates anomalies during routine shower windows."
Validation of presence-linked safety temperature caps under anomalies,"When safety features cap maximum temperatures in the presence of a user, anomaly alerts with very high temperatures and concurrent proximity indicate that those caps are being exceeded or not applied correctly during abnormal conditions.",4,"Shows safety cap failures while users are present."
Estimating unobserved energy loss from no-presence hot anomalies,Summing the thermal energy (from elevated temperature and abnormal flow) across anomaly alerts where proximity shows no presence provides an estimate of energy lost to hot-water anomalies that nobody in the building directly experiences.,3,"Quantifies energy loss during absent hot anomalies."
