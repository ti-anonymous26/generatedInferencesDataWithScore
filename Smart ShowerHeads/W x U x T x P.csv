Per-session comfort–efficiency profile with verified presence,"For each usage log session, intersect its duration with periods of continuous proximity and analyze the corresponding flow rate and temperature; this yields a comfort–efficiency profile showing how much water and heat is used while a user is actually present under their chosen temperature.",4,"Profiles comfort and resource use tied to presence and temperature, revealing individual habits."
Cold-start waste with user waiting for warm water,"When proximity shows a user has arrived and a session has started, measure flow volume from the flow history until temperature reaches the user’s typical comfort band; this volume is cold-start waste incurred while the user waits near the fixture.",3,"Captures waiting behavior and comfort band, moderately exposing user experience."
Detection of water left running after user departure,"Within a usage session, identify intervals where flow remains above a threshold and temperature is stable, but proximity shows the user has left; this combination reveals water and energy wasted when the fixture is left running without anyone present.",4,"Shows water left on after departure, highlighting specific user lapses."
True dwell time vs logged session length,"Compare the total session duration in usage logs with the interval from first to last proximity activation, then overlay flow and temperature; the difference shows how much of the logged session is actual user dwell with meaningful water use and at what temperature.",4,"Measures actual dwell vs logged time with comfort context, revealing detailed presence patterns."

Estimating pre-use flushing volume guided by presence and temperature,"For each session, isolate the period after proximity begins and flow starts but before temperature stabilizes in the user’s comfort band; integrating flow here gives an estimate of flushing volume users incur to obtain clean or warm water.",3,"Quantifies flushing before comfort reached, reflecting user patience and habits."
Detecting sensor misalignment via comfort-like usage without presence,"Sequences of stable warm temperature, typical shower-length flow profiles, and logged sessions that lack matching proximity activity suggest that the proximity sensor is misaligned or blind to the area where users actually stand during normal use.",2,"Primarily finds sensor blind spots; limited incremental personal exposure."
Detecting nuisance proximity triggers with no hydraulic or thermal change,"Short proximity activations unaccompanied by session creation, meaningful flow changes, or temperature adjustments indicate nuisance triggers such as people walking by, which can be used to refine sensor sensitivity and field of view.",2,"Identifies false triggers without real use; low personal detail."
Comfort stability index during continuous presence,"For each session, during intervals where proximity is continuously active and flow is above a minimum threshold, compute temperature variance; lower variance indicates stable thermal comfort as experienced by the user, while higher variance signals unstable mixing or heater control.",3,"Evaluates comfort stability during presence, reflecting user experience quality."
Flow–temperature coupling under active presence,Analyze how temperature changes in response to adjustments in flow only during periods with continuous presence; this reveals how well the system maintains comfort when users switch between strong and gentle spray while standing at the fixture.,2,"Assesses system response during presence; technical with limited behavioral profiling."
Detection of pre-use safety checks for children,"Short sessions where a taller user presence is detected first, temperature is adjusted and tested with modest flow, then a second presence pattern suggests a smaller/shorter user, indicate parental pre-checking and adjustment of water temperature for children.",5,"Infers multi-person roles and child safety checks, highly sensitive interpersonal behavior."
Differentiating cleaning vs personal hygiene via four-signal pattern,"Cleaning sessions exhibit irregular usage logs (multiple short entries), intermittent or moving proximity patterns, variable flow, and cooler or more variable temperatures, whereas hygiene sessions show fewer, longer logs, more stable presence, steadier flow, and warmer temperatures.",4,"Classifies activity type (cleaning vs hygiene) using presence, flow, and temperature, revealing routines."
Quantifying energy-efficient behavior for comparable comfort,"For sessions with similar presence durations and comfort temperature bands, compare integrated flow volumes; lower volume for comparable presence and temperature indicates more water-efficient behavior (e.g., efficient shower vs wasteful shower).",4,"Compares resource use for similar comfort, profiling individual efficiency."
Heat-loss characterization between consecutive presence events,"After a session with stable warm temperatures ends and proximity vanishes, track how long it takes for temperature to drop near baseline before the next presence event; this reveals pipe and fixture heat retention characteristics relevant to perceived comfort at next use.",2,"Focuses on system heat retention with minimal direct behavioral exposure."
