Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Consistently high flow rates indicate a high-demand fixture,"If the flow rate history frequently stays near the upper expected range, it suggests that the faucet or showerhead is regularly used at strong flow, reflecting high water demand at that point.",3,"Shows preference for high flow tied to tasks/routines."
Consistently low flow rates suggest conservative or restricted use,"Flow rates that typically remain near the lower range over time indicate users prefer gentle or reduced flow, possibly for water-saving, comfort, or task-specific reasons.",2,"Indicates low-flow preference with limited identity."
Frequent rapid spikes in flow rate reveal burst-like usage patterns,Short-lived flow surges followed by quick drops indicate users often open the faucet quickly at high flow for brief tasks like rinsing or flushing.,2,"Burst patterns imply task style with modest identifiability."
Long periods of steady high flow suggest extended intensive use,"Flow rate remaining high and relatively constant for extended durations implies long showers or continuous tasks that require strong, uninterrupted water flow.",3,"Signals long high-intensity use windows."
Long periods of steady low flow indicate prolonged low-intensity usage,"Sustained low-level flow over time suggests prolonged but gentle usage, such as slow rinsing or continuous trickle-style operation.",2,"Prolonged gentle use; low identity risk."
Gradual ramp-up in flow rate during sessions indicates incremental adjustment behavior,Patterns where the flow rate slowly increases from low to high within a session suggest users tend to start gently and then raise flow as needed.,2,"Shows gradual adjustment style."
Gradual ramp-down in flow rate indicates soft shutoff habits,"Flow rate that decreases in steps rather than abrupt stops suggests users slowly reduce flow before turning off, possibly to avoid splashing or noise.",2,"Soft shutoff habit with limited profiling."
Abrupt transitions between zero and high flow show snap-on/snap-off usage style,Flow rate jumps directly from zero to near peak and back indicate users quickly open and close the faucet to a preferred maximum without intermediate adjustments.,2,"Snap usage style; modest behavioral exposure."
Daily flow rate peaks reveal time-of-day demand concentration,Flow rate history showing repeated peaks at specific times indicates when water demand is highest at that fixture.,3,"Reveals routine demand windows."
Night-time flow rate activity suggests off-peak use or anomalies,"Non-zero flow rates during late-night hours, when usage is typically low, may indicate late routines, unusual schedules, or potential leak-like behavior.",4,"Exposes night presence or leak risk."
Weekend flow rate patterns different from weekdays indicate schedule-linked demand,"If average or peak flow rates differ on weekends, it implies that water demand is tied to workday versus off-day routines.",3,"Shows weekend vs weekday habits."
Seasonal increase in average flow rate implies climate-driven usage changes,"Higher typical flow rates during certain seasons suggest stronger or longer use in response to weather, such as more showers in hot periods.",2,"Seasonal shift with limited identity."
Seasonal decrease in average flow rate reflects reduced intensity needs,Lower flow rates in cooler seasons indicate users are using less intense water flow or shorter high-flow periods in those months.,2,"Seasonal reduction; low identifiability."
Rising long-term average flow rate shows increasing water intensity over time,A long-term upward trend in mean flow rate suggests that newer usage behavior involves stronger water flow or reduced use of low-flow settings.,3,"Indicates growing intensity tied to occupants’ habits."
Declining long-term average flow rate indicates shifting toward conservation,A gradual decrease in the typical flow rate over weeks or months implies that users are moving toward more water-efficient habits or have adjusted preferences.,3,"Shows conservation trend in behavior."
Frequent oscillation between low and high flow during a session suggests fine-tuning for comfort,Repeated up-and-down changes in flow rate within single usage periods indicate active adjustment while users seek a comfortable or effective level.,3,"Captures active adjustment behavior."
Stable flow patterns with minimal variability imply set-and-leave behavior,Sessions where flow rate remains nearly constant after initial onset suggest users set the flow once and rarely adjust it mid-use.,2,"Set-and-leave style; low identity risk."
High peak flow rates relative to typical baseline indicate occasional intensive tasks,"Rare, very high flow episodes compared to normal levels suggest occasional heavy-use scenarios, such as heavy cleaning or strong rinsing.",2,"Occasional intensive tasks with limited personal detail."
Low peak flow rates over extended history indicate hardware or design constraints,"If historical flow rates never approach expected higher ranges, it may reflect that the fixture or plumbing restricts maximum flow, such as low-flow design or small pipes.",1,"Hardware constraint insight, minimal behavioral exposure."
Baseline non-zero flow rate indicates potential continuous leakage,"If the flow rate history shows a persistent low flow even when the fixture is expected to be off, it strongly suggests a continuous leak or incomplete shutoff.",3,"Indicates ongoing leak, exposes off-hours behavior."
Gradually increasing baseline flow over time signals worsening leak behavior,A creeping rise in the minimum observed flow rate indicates that a small leak may be getting worse.,3,"Shows leak worsening over time; infers off-hour flow."
Sudden jump in baseline flow rate indicates onset of a new leak or malfunction,"When the minimum flow rate abruptly steps up and remains higher than before, it suggests a newly developed leak or component failure allowing unintended flow.",3,"Reveals new leak onset timing."
Flow rate spikes immediately after start indicate pressure or inertia effects in use,"If flow history shows a brief overshoot above steady-state early in each session, it suggests users open quickly and the system experiences a pressure or inertia-driven surge.",2,"Shows quick-open habit; minor profiling."
Slow stabilization of flow rate after start indicates gradual manual adjustment,A pattern where flow starts at one level and then slowly settles into another suggests users fine-tune flow shortly after initial activation.,2,"Early-session adjustment style."
Multiple high-flow episodes within a short window imply clustered heavy usage,Several separate high-flow pulses in a narrow time window suggest repeated high-intensity tasks rather than steady continuous use.,3,"Indicates clustered heavy tasks and timing."
Asymmetric flow distribution indicates conservative typical usage with occasional heavy use,"Flow rate history dominated by low or moderate values, punctuated by rare high peaks, reflects mostly efficient use with occasional intensive tasks.",2,"Mostly efficient usage pattern; limited identity."
Symmetric distribution around a mid-range flow indicates balanced use,"If flow rates are commonly centered around a mid-level with fewer extremes, users likely rely on a moderate flow setting for most tasks.",2,"Balanced usage with low identifiability."
High variance in flow rate within sessions suggests experimentation or multiple sub-tasks,"Wide within-session variation in measured flow rates implies that users are frequently changing flow to support different sub-tasks such as filling, rinsing, and gentle washing.",3,"Reveals multi-subtask behavior."
Low variance in flow rate across sessions indicates strongly standardized behavior,"Similar flow rate patterns across many sessions point to very standardized, repeatable usage habits.",3,"Standardized habits aid profiling."
Differences in typical flow rates across fixtures reveal role differentiation,"Comparing flow histories shows which fixtures are used for high-flow tasks like showers and which are used with gentle, low flow like handwashing.",2,"Role differentiation with limited personal detail."
Flow rate peaks aligning with known supply patterns suggest dependence on mains pressure,"If higher flow rates consistently occur at times when supply pressure is higher, behavior likely follows supply conditions as much as user preference.",1,"Supply-driven pattern; minimal personal exposure."
Flow rate suppression in certain periods indicates self-imposed or external limitations,Reduced flow rates at specific times show adaptation to constraints such as perceived pressure issues or intentional off-peak conservation.,2,"Shows adaptation to constraints, limited identity."
Daily cumulative flow volume derived from rate history indicates total water consumption,Integrating flow rate over a day gives total usage; increasing or decreasing trends reflect growing or shrinking daily water consumption at the fixture.,3,"Totals expose overall demand tied to routines."
Uneven distribution of cumulative flow over the day reveals dominant consumption windows,"When derived cumulative volume grows fastest during specific time windows, those periods are where most water is consumed.",3,"Shows main consumption windows."
Flow rate patterns with frequent near-zero flickers suggest micro-uses or sensor noise,"Many very short, very low flow events can indicate either tiny incidental uses like quick splashes or noise in measurement.",1,"Likely noise or micro-uses with low identifiability."
Long sequences of zero flow interrupted by sharp peaks indicate clearly separated usage episodes,Clear alternation between zero flow and strong discrete peaks implies highly episodic usage with little in-between activity.,2,"Episodic pattern; limited identity."
Reduction in maximum achieved flow rate over time may indicate partial clogging or degradation,"If historical maximums slowly decline, it can indicate narrowing pipes, aerator clogging, or partial obstruction.",1,"Hardware degradation insight; minimal personal data."
Increase in maximum achieved flow rate may indicate hardware upgrades or restriction removal,"A step increase in observed peak flow, persisting across sessions, suggests a change like aerator replacement, valve adjustment, or plumbing modification that allows more flow.",1,"Upgrade signal; little behavioral info."
Correlation between flow rate height and session duration suggests preference for particular modes,"If longer sessions consistently use one flow range and shorter sessions another, it implies distinct low-flow short tasks and high-flow long tasks behaviors.",3,"Links flow level to session type, profiling habits."
Steeper flow ramps at specific times of day indicate time-pressured routines,"When sessions at particular times show very fast transitions to high flow and short durations, those windows likely correspond to rushed routines such as pre-commute use.",3,"Reveals rushed routine times."
