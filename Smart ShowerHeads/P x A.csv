inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as user-present vs user-absent,"Compare each flow anomaly alert window with proximity activation data; anomalies that occur while proximity shows a user nearby likely reflect intense user-driven usage, whereas anomalies during user-absent periods strongly suggest leaks or system faults.",3,"Distinguishes user-driven vs unattended anomalies, revealing occupancy context."
Leak likelihood scoring based on absence of presence,"Assign higher leak-likelihood scores to anomaly alerts that happen when proximity sensors report no user presence before, during, or shortly after the event, as these are less likely to correspond to legitimate use.",3,"Absence-based scoring exposes when spaces are empty."
Detection of unattended running water,"Identify anomalies where proximity data shows a user initially present but then absent for most of the alert duration, indicating water continues to run abnormally after the user leaves the detection zone.",4,"Shows departure times and unattended flow risk."
Unauthorized or unexpected usage detection,"Flow anomaly alerts that coincide with unexpected proximity activity during off-hours (e.g., at night or outside business hours) can indicate unauthorized access or tampering at the fixture.",4,"Reveals off-hour presence, significant profiling/security risk."
Sensor or valve fault detection via mismatch,"Repeated anomaly alerts with no proximity activations and no known scheduled uses may indicate a stuck valve or faulty plumbing component rather than normal usage, even when humans are not present.",1,"Focuses on faults, minimal behavioral exposure."
Distinguish crowd-driven anomalies from mechanical failures,"Clusters of anomaly alerts overlapping with dense, overlapping proximity activations suggest crowd-induced heavy usage (e.g., in public restrooms), while anomalies without crowd presence point toward mechanical or plumbing issues.",3,"Exposes crowding/co-occupancy periods."
Auto-shutoff behavior evaluation during anomalies,"Measure how proximity patterns change after an anomaly alert; if presence disappears but alerts persist, auto-shutoff may be ineffective. If alerts stop soon after presence ends, shutoff logic is likely working correctly.",2,"Uses presence timing; limited identity risk."
Detection of persistent background anomalies in empty spaces,Anomalies repeatedly occurring when proximity shows no presence over extended periods indicate persistent background issues such as continuous small leaks or faulty recirculation rather than user behavior.,3,"Empty-space anomalies reveal absence windows and background issues."
Anomaly severity perception estimation,"Combine anomaly duration with proximity duration; anomalies that occur while users remain present for a long time may be noticed and disruptive, while user-absent anomalies might be silent but more damaging (e.g., hidden leaks).",3,"Links presence duration to impact, showing occupancy patterns."
Proximity sensor coverage validation during anomalies,"Anomalies frequently overlapping with water usage but rarely accompanied by proximity activations suggest that sensors may not adequately cover the area where users stand, indicating a need for repositioning or additional sensors.",2,"Highlights coverage gaps; minor behavior detail."
Differentiating cleaning anomalies from misuse,"Repeated anomaly alerts that occur with long, continuous proximity presence can indicate legitimate high-demand activities like cleaning cycles, distinct from anomalies with little or no presence that imply leaks or hardware failures.",3,"Infers activity type and extended presence."
Detection of accidental obstruction of proximity sensors,"If anomaly alerts and prolonged water use occur without corresponding proximity activations, yet users are likely present, this can indicate that an object is blocking the sensor and preventing it from detecting presence.",2,"Suggests obstruction with limited behavioral exposure."
Calibrating anomaly alert severity with presence context,"Use presence information to tune alert severity: anomalies with no proximity presence get higher priority, while anomalies during clearly busy periods with continuous presence may be downgraded unless extremely large or frequent.",2,"Severity tuning with occupancy context, modest exposure."
Detection of user attempts to stop anomalies,"Look for bursts of proximity activity during an anomaly window followed by a return to normal conditions; this pattern suggests users are reacting to unusual flow (e.g., attempting to close a stuck faucet).",3,"Shows reactive user actions and timing."
Identifying fixtures prone to misuse during crowds,Fixtures that show frequent anomaly alerts specifically when proximity data indicates dense usage (many activations) may be prone to misuse or accidental overuse when the area is crowded.,3,"Reveals misuse during crowding; co-occupancy signal."
Anomaly recurrence under similar presence conditions,"Analyze combinations of presence duration and pattern around repeated anomalies; if similar proximity patterns (e.g., long single-person presence) repeatedly precede alerts, this suggests certain user behaviors or fixtures trigger anomalies more often.",3,"Patterns tie anomalies to routine presence styles."
Detection of ghost anomalies caused by sensor or system noise,"Anomalies that occur with absolutely no proximity activity before, during, or after the alert, especially if brief and low-impact, may indicate sensor noise or system glitches rather than real physical abnormalities.",1,"Sensor-noise identification, minimal personal info."
Presence-informed anomaly suppression rules,"Use historical correlations to suppress or down-rank anomaly alerts that consistently occur during well-understood, frequent presence patterns (e.g., short bursts of presence) when they have been verified as harmless.",2,"Uses typical presence patterns; low profiling risk."
Early warning for fixture tampering or vandalism,"Anomalies that occur alongside unusual proximity patterns (e.g., rapid back-and-forth movements or very long continuous presence in public spaces) may signal tampering with the faucet or sensor.",4,"Highlights suspicious presence behavior; high security sensitivity."
Detection of abandoned fixtures in public spaces,Frequent anomaly alerts with no accompanying proximity in fixtures located in low-traffic areas suggest neglected or poorly monitored fixtures that may require inspection or decommissioning.,2,"Indicates unused areas and absence patterns."
Evaluating effectiveness of user-facing anomaly notifications,"When user-visible alarms are supposed to prompt immediate action, measure whether proximity activity rapidly appears near the fixture after anomaly alerts and whether anomalies then cease, indicating that users respond to alerts.",3,"Shows responsiveness timing linked to presence."
Segregating occupancy-related anomalies from infrastructure ones,"By examining how many anomalies occur during periods with high proximity activity versus no activity, the system can quantify what fraction of anomalies are tied to occupancy peaks versus underlying infrastructure problems.",3,"Splits anomalies by occupancy, revealing activity peaks."
Pattern-based prediction of user-absent anomaly risk,"Use combinations of past presence gaps and subsequent anomalies to identify times when user-absent anomalies are more likely, potentially raising background monitoring or triggering pre-emptive checks when spaces are empty.",4,"Predicts issues during absences, exposing absence schedules."
Anomaly-driven security camera activation logic,Couple anomaly alerts with proximity data to define when to activate nearby security cameras or logging: anomalies plus unexpected proximity at odd hours represent higher security risk than anomalies without presence.,4,"Combines anomalies with odd-hour presence; high privacy/security impact."
Classification of anomalies into immediate vs latent risk,"Anomalies with no concurrent or near-concurrent proximity but extended duration are likely to represent latent infrastructure risk (e.g., hidden leaks), while anomalies during active presence may be more immediately noticeable and self-limiting.",3,"Uses presence vs absence to assess risk, reveals occupancy windows."
Validation of occupancy model using anomaly context,"If occupancy schedules predict spaces to be empty yet anomalies coinciding with proximity appear, this mismatch highlights errors in occupancy assumptions or deviations from expected building use.",3,"Exposes deviations from expected occupancy schedules."
Locating anomalies associated with specific approach paths,"Patterns where anomalies are always preceded by proximity activations from a given sensor zone (e.g., a particular approach side) may indicate that certain approach angles or movements cause unintended overactivation and abnormal flows.",3,"Maps movement paths to anomalies, modest profiling."
Triggering different mitigation strategies based on presence,"Use presence context to select mitigation: anomalies during no-presence windows could trigger immediate remote shutoff, while anomalies during active presence might first provide audible or visual warnings to let users correct behavior.",3,"Mitigation choice depends on occupancy timing."
Long-term risk profiling of fixtures by anomaly–presence ratio,"For each fixture, compute the ratio of user-absent to user-present anomalies; fixtures with a high fraction of user-absent anomalies represent long-term structural risk and should be prioritized for inspection or redesign.",3,"Ratios reveal absence-heavy anomalies, indicating risk patterns."
