Time-of-day temperature preference profiling,"Combine session timestamps from usage logs with the corresponding temperature levels during those sessions to build a profile of preferred water temperature at different times of day (e.g., hotter showers at night, milder in the morning).",4,"Reveals daily comfort preferences tied to routine times."
Session-type classification by duration and temperature,"Use usage log durations together with typical temperature levels to infer session types: short, lukewarm events likely correspond to handwashing, whereas long, consistently warm sessions are more indicative of showers or baths.",4,"Infers activity type (shower vs handwash) and habits."
Multi-user pattern clustering without explicit identity,"Cluster sessions using both duration (from usage logs) and average temperature to uncover distinct patterns that likely belong to different household members (e.g., one person prefers 40°C for 20 minutes, another prefers 37°C for 10 minutes).",5,"Enables de facto user identification via behavior clusters."
Stability of individual routines over time,"Track how the joint distribution of session duration and temperature changes over weeks; stable clusters indicate consistent routines, while drifting clusters suggest changes in habits or household composition.",4,"Shows persistence or change in personal routines."
Seasonal adjustment of temperature choices,Compare typical session temperatures in usage logs across different months; higher temperatures for similar-duration sessions in winter versus summer indicate seasonal adaptation in comfort preferences.,3,"Seasonal preference shifts with moderate identifiability."
Detection of unusually long hot-water sessions,"Identify sessions where both the duration and average temperature are above historical norms, highlighting potentially excessive hot-water use that can increase energy costs and scalding risk.",3,"Flags excessive hot use tied to specific sessions."
Ramp-up time to comfort temperature per session,"Within each session from the usage logs, measure how long it takes for temperature to rise from initial value to the user’s typical target range; longer ramp-up times indicate plumbing inefficiencies or undersized heaters.",2,"Performance metric with minor behavior exposure."
Night-time hot-water usage characterization,"Cross-analyze session timestamps and temperature traces to see whether late-night water uses tend to be hotter and longer (relaxing showers) compared with shorter, cooler morning sessions.",4,"Reveals night routines and comfort choices."
Health or sensitivity indicators from gentle-temperature patterns,"Persistently low shower temperatures and moderate durations in usage logs can suggest sensitivity to heat, dermatological conditions, or deliberate use of milder temperatures for health reasons.",4,"Potentially health-related preferences, sensitive."
Impact of conservation or pricing nudges on hot-water behavior,"Before and after a savings campaign or tariff change, compare distributions of session duration and average temperature to see if users respond by shortening hot sessions or lowering temperature setpoints.",2,"Aggregated behavior change with limited identity."
Two-phase shower behavior detection,"Within longer sessions in the usage logs, analyze temperature trends to detect phases such as an initially hotter washing phase followed by a cooler rinsing phase, giving insight into detailed shower routines.",4,"Exposes detailed in-shower routine phases."
Temperature overshoot at session start (scalding risk),"Look for sessions where temperature briefly spikes above a safe threshold right after they start in the usage logs, revealing scalding risk during the first few seconds of use.",3,"Shows unsafe spikes at session start, tied to routine times."
Short high-temperature bursts as hand-sterilization events,"Identify very short sessions with unusually high temperatures in the temperature trend, often correlated with quick disinfection or sterilization uses rather than standard handwashing or showering.",3,"Infers specialized high-temp tasks at precise times."
Routine inference from habitual time–temperature–duration combinations,"Repeated patterns of sessions at similar times, durations, and temperatures (e.g., 10-minute, 38°C shower at 11 PM) indicate strongly ingrained daily routines that the system can anticipate for preheating or recommendations.",5,"Highly identifying habitual routine signature."
Comfort versus efficiency trade-off analysis per user pattern,"For each cluster of sessions of similar duration, examine the average temperature; higher temperatures at unchanged durations increase energy use, allowing the system to quantify how much comfort is costing in energy terms.",3,"Links comfort choices to energy use per pattern."
Detection of abrupt behavioral change,"Spot significant shifts in the joint pattern of session durations and temperatures—such as suddenly shorter showers or lower temperatures—which may reflect lifestyle changes, new occupants, or response to external events.",3,"Shows lifestyle or occupancy shifts."
Identification of brief temperature adjustment struggles,"Within sessions, count how many times temperature changes direction (up then down, or vice versa); multiple quick adjustments in a short-duration session suggest difficulty finding a comfortable temperature quickly.",3,"Captures difficulty finding comfort during a session."
Distinguishing cleaning cycles from personal hygiene,"Sessions characterized by cooler water and variable duration, especially at irregular times, can be separated from consistent warm-temperature, typical-length showers to infer cleaning tasks versus personal hygiene usage.",4,"Infers activity type (cleaning vs hygiene) from patterns."
Daily hot-water demand curve by session type,"Combine session counts and durations with their corresponding temperature levels to construct a daily curve of hot-water demand for different uses (e.g., hot showers vs lukewarm handwashing) rather than just total usage.",3,"Demand profile by type, moderate identifiability."
Comfort consistency for individual patterns,Analyze how tightly clustered the temperatures are for sessions of similar duration and time-of-day; narrow temperature ranges suggest users have found and consistently use a comfortable setting.,3,"Shows consistency of personal comfort settings."
Detection of potentially unsafe child usage patterns,"If usage logs identify short sessions at times associated with children (e.g., after school) and temperature trends show occasional high spikes, it may indicate that children occasionally reach unsafe temperatures and require tighter safety limits.",5,"Highlights child-related safety risks at specific times."
Inference of pre- and post-exercise usage,"Repeated sessions occurring after typical exercise times with characteristic longer duration and specific temperature ranges (often warm but not scalding) can be tagged as post-exercise showers, providing insight into lifestyle patterns.",4,"Reveals exercise-linked routines."
Comparison of weekday vs weekend hot-water routines,"Contrast weekday and weekend distributions of session duration and temperature to see if people take longer, hotter showers on weekends and shorter, more functional showers during workdays.",3,"Shows schedule-based preference shifts."
Detection of basin-only warm water habits,"Very short sessions with modestly elevated temperatures clustered around specific times can reveal habits like briefly running warm water at a sink, different from full showers, which can guide targeted sink-side conservation tips.",3,"Identifies sink-side warm water habits and timing."
Identification of consistently excessive hot-water use,"Flag patterns where many sessions are both long and above a high temperature threshold, showing users with systematically high hot-water consumption that could be addressed with tailored feedback or limits.",3,"Profiles heavy hot-water users over time."
Estimation of comfort window width for each pattern,"For each cluster of sessions with similar duration and time-of-day, compute the spread of temperatures actually used; a narrow comfort window suggests specific preferences, while a wider window suggests flexibility and more room for savings.",3,"Quantifies preference rigidity per pattern."
Evaluation of temperature-limiting policy effectiveness,"After maximum temperature limits are imposed, compare previously typical session temperatures with new distributions; any sessions that used to exceed the new cap but now sit at the limit indicate successful enforcement without loss of usage frequency or duration.",2,"Policy impact with limited personal detail."
Correlation between shorter showers and temperature adjustments,"Study whether users who adopt shorter sessions (per usage logs) also adjust temperatures downward; if durations drop but temperatures rise, overall energy savings may be less than expected.",3,"Links duration changes to temperature choices."
Detection of ‘comfort testing’ sessions after configuration changes,Short bursts of sessions with varying temperatures and irregular durations shortly after system or heater adjustments indicate users are exploring the new temperature behavior to find a comfortable setting.,3,"Shows exploration behavior after changes."
