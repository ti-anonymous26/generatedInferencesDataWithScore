Per-session comfort profile classification,"Use the joint pattern of flow rate over time and corresponding temperature curve to classify sessions into comfort profiles (e.g., long high-flow at 38–40°C for showers, short low-flow at lukewarm temperatures for handwashing).",4,"Reveals detailed hygiene preferences and session types tied to individuals."
Hot-water energy use per session,"Combine integrated flow volume with the temperature level above an assumed cold-water baseline to estimate the thermal energy used in each session, enabling per-event energy footprints rather than just water volume reporting.",2,"Per-session energy footprint with limited routine detail."
Cold-start water waste estimation,"Identify periods at the start of each session where flow is non-zero but the temperature has not yet reached the user’s typical comfort range, and sum that volume to estimate how much water is wasted while waiting for it to warm up.",2,"Shows wait-to-warm behavior but little identity linkage."
Scalding risk episode detection,"Detect intervals where both the measured temperature exceeds a safety threshold and the flow rate is high enough to realistically contact skin, flagging true scalding-risk events rather than harmless brief temperature spikes.",3,"Highlights high-heat contact times, exposing safety-relevant usage moments."
Preferred shower temperature by flow intensity,"For sessions with sustained flow rates typical of showers, compute the most frequent temperature levels actually achieved during those flows to infer each user’s preferred shower temperature at their usual flow intensity.",4,"Directly infers personal comfort settings for showers."
Seasonal comfort setting drift,"Compare typical temperatures at similar flow rates across different months or seasons to see whether users raise temperatures in colder months and reduce them when it is warmer, indicating climate-driven adaptation of hot-water usage.",2,"Coarse seasonal adjustment info with low identifiability."
Flow-dependent heater capacity limit detection,"Analyze how maximum achievable temperature changes as flow rate increases; if the temperature plateaus or drops sharply beyond a certain flow level, it indicates the heater is reaching or exceeding its effective capacity at that throughput.",1,"System performance metric, not user-specific."
Cross-fixture competition for hot water,"When total flow rate spikes (from multiple fixtures using hot water simultaneously) and the temperature trace drops at the same time, it reveals competition for hot water and possible pressure or capacity constraints in the shared system.",3,"Indicates concurrent use and co-occupancy periods."
Temperature stability index vs flow,"Measure the variance of temperature within sessions at different average flow rates; if temperature is more stable at specific flow ranges, it indicates that certain flow intensities are better for maintaining consistent shower comfort.",1,"Technical stability measure with minimal personal data."
Optimal flow rate for stable temperature,"By correlating temperature fluctuations with varying flow rates in many sessions, identify a range of flow rates where the temperature curve stays most stable, which can be recommended as an optimal comfort setting for users.",1,"Generalized guidance with little identity risk."
Heater or thermostat malfunction detection,"Look for irregular temperature oscillations or sudden drops and spikes that appear while the flow rate remains steady, suggesting thermostat misbehavior, scaling in the heater, or other heater-side faults rather than user adjustment.",1,"Fault detection without behavioral exposure."
Mixing valve wear detection,"Compare historical sessions that have similar flow patterns; if more recent sessions show larger unintended temperature swings at comparable flow rates, it may indicate wear or sticking in the mixing valve or cartridge.",1,"Equipment wear insight, not user behavior."
Pipe insulation effectiveness estimation,"Use temperature ramp-up behavior at the start of flow and cooling rate after flow stops across seasons and different flow rates to infer how quickly heat is lost in the plumbing, which reflects the effectiveness of pipe insulation.",1,"Infrastructure efficiency metric with minimal personal link."
Identification of rinse-only segments within sessions,"Within longer sessions, detect phases where flow is high but the user briefly lowers the temperature or where temperature drops slightly while flow increases, indicating rinsing phases that can be separated from the main washing phase.",3,"Exposes in-session routine phases."
Overheating without corresponding high flow,"Find intervals where temperature rises significantly while flow is very low or intermittent, suggesting inefficient preheating or a system that keeps water too hot even when there is almost no actual usage at the outlet.",2,"Shows inefficient behavior but limited identity exposure."
Efficient vs inefficient handwashing detection,"For short, low-volume sessions, compare the achieved temperature curve with the flow rate; if most water flows while the temperature is still ramping, the user is effectively using hot water inefficiently for handwashing and could switch to cold-only use.",3,"Reveals handwashing habits and efficiency."
Energy-saving potential from lower temperature settings,"Combine current flow volumes and achieved temperatures to estimate total thermal energy consumption, then simulate scenarios where target temperatures are reduced a few degrees at similar flows to quantify potential energy savings.",2,"Aggregated savings insight with low personal detail."
Comfort–energy tradeoff characterization,"Analyze clusters of sessions with similar flow rates but different temperatures to see how much extra energy is used for each incremental degree of heat, supporting recommendations about the temperature level that balances comfort and efficiency.",3,"Links comfort choices to energy use, profiling preferences."
Thermal shock detection during showers,"Identify events where temperature changes abruptly by several degrees while the flow rate remains continuous and significant, indicating thermal shocks that users may find uncomfortable or unsafe, often caused by other fixtures drawing water.",3,"Captures moments during showers, exposing experience timing."
Day vs night hot-water usage characteristics,"Contrast daytime and nighttime sessions in terms of combined flow and temperature patterns to reveal whether users take hotter, longer showers at night or prefer quicker, cooler use in the morning.",4,"Reveals hygiene timing and intensity tied to daily routine."
Distinguishing cleaning vs personal hygiene usage,Use characteristic temperature and flow combinations—such as cooler water at high flow for cleaning surfaces versus warmer water at moderate flow for showers—to infer dominant activity types without direct labeling.,4,"Infers activity type (cleaning vs personal hygiene) from patterns."
Hot-side vs cold-side leak characterization,"If persistent low-level flow is accompanied by elevated temperatures relative to the cold baseline, the leak likely involves the hot-water side; conversely, low-temperature drips at low flow indicate a cold-side or mixed-line issue.",1,"Leak source identification without behavior detail."
Safe maximum flow recommendations per temperature range,"Analyze historical instances where high temperatures and high flows coincided uncomfortably, then derive recommended upper bounds on flow for given temperature ranges to keep combinations within safe and comfortable envelopes.",1,"Safety guidance with negligible personal exposure."
Crowding-induced performance degradation analysis,"During periods of sustained high flow, track simultaneous temperature drops to quantify how much comfort degrades under peak demand, which can guide infrastructure improvements or usage scheduling in shared facilities.",3,"Signals peak concurrent use and shared-demand windows."
Habitual overheating relative to climate season,Compare typical chosen temperatures at given flow levels with ambient season or climate proxies; consistently high temperatures even in warm seasons indicate habitual overheating and a large energy- and water-saving opportunity.,3,"Shows personal tendency toward high temps across seasons."
Temperature sensor calibration validation using flow transitions,Examine how measured temperature responds at the precise moments when flow starts and stops; unrealistic lag or overshoot patterns across many on/off transitions suggest that the temperature sensor calibration or placement needs adjustment.,1,"Calibration check with no meaningful behavioral data."
Infrastructure aging impact on time-to-hot water,"Track how long it takes for temperature to reach a typical comfortable level after flow starts for sessions over months or years; increasing time-to-hot at similar flow rates indicates aging pipes, sediment buildup, or degrading heater performance.",1,"Infrastructure aging metric with minimal personal link."
Optimal recirculation or preheat scheduling,"By aligning when users actually demand hot water (indicated by flow) with the temperature ramp-up patterns, infer the best times to run recirculation or preheating cycles so that hot water is available quickly while minimizing idle heat loss.",3,"Aligns hot-water availability to habitual demand times, revealing routine windows."
