inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as in-session versus idle-period events,"Align each flow anomaly alert timestamp with usage log intervals; alerts that occur entirely within an active usage session likely reflect intense but intentional water use, whereas alerts occurring when no session is logged indicate probable leaks or unintended flow.",3,"Separates user-driven from idle anomalies, revealing occupancy context."
Leak likelihood scoring based on absence of usage,"For each anomaly, check whether there is any overlapping usage log entry; anomaly events with no overlapping or nearby logged usage are given a higher leak-likelihood score than those that coincide with active sessions.",3,"Absence-based scoring exposes empty-window events."
Night-time anomaly criticality detection,Cross-reference anomaly timestamps with usage logs to find alerts that occur during hours when usage is normally minimal or absent; anomalies in these log-defined low-use periods are more likely to represent serious leaks rather than legitimate heavy use.,4,"Highlights night/low-use anomalies, revealing presence schedules."
Mapping anomalies to specific usage sessions,"When anomaly alerts overlap with usage log sessions, attach those alerts to the corresponding sessions to build a per-session anomaly history, which supports detailed analysis of problematic uses or fixtures.",3,"Ties anomalies to sessions, linking to user routines."
User response time to anomaly alerts,"Measure the time difference between an anomaly alert and the end of the overlapping usage log session; short delays suggest that users promptly stop water after being notified, while long delays imply either alert ignorance or poor visibility of alerts.",4,"Measures user reaction timing to alerts."
Detection of forgotten or stuck-on sessions,Identify very long usage log sessions that trigger anomaly alerts and continue far beyond the alert time; this pattern suggests a faucet or shower left running unintentionally or a valve stuck open.,4,"Shows prolonged unattended use; strong behavior signal."
False-positive anomaly identification from routine heavy sessions,"If anomaly alerts regularly occur during specific recurring long or high-frequency usage patterns in the logs (e.g., weekly cleaning sessions), those alerts can be tagged as likely false positives and used to refine anomaly thresholds for those time windows.",3,"Associates anomalies with known routines."
Usage-intensity–adjusted anomaly rate per fixture,"Using the number and total duration of sessions per fixture from usage logs together with anomaly counts associated with each fixture, compute an anomaly rate normalized by usage intensity (e.g., alerts per 100 hours of use) to compare the relative health of fixtures.",2,"Fixture health metric with modest behavior context."
Detection of chronic problem periods,Aggregate anomaly alerts by time-of-day or day-of-week and normalize by session counts from usage logs; times with disproportionately high anomaly-to-session ratios indicate chronic stress windows that may require configuration or hardware changes.,3,"Reveals routine stress windows tied to schedules."
Post-anomaly behavioral change analysis,"After a major anomaly event, examine subsequent usage logs to see whether average session durations or the frequency of long sessions decrease, indicating that users have altered behavior in response to alerts or repairs.",3,"Tracks behavior change after alerts."
Vacation or away-mode anomaly detection,"When usage logs show almost no sessions over a multi-day period, any anomaly alerts within that interval strongly suggest leaks or failures occurring while the premises are unoccupied.",4,"Exposes absence periods; high privacy sensitivity."
"Anomaly position within session (start, middle, end)","Determine whether each anomaly alert falls near the beginning, middle, or end of a usage session from the logs; anomalies at session start may indicate valve or startup issues, while mid-session anomalies might reflect peak-demand or user-driven extremes.",3,"Shows in-session timing, linking to user actions."
Segmentation of high-risk session types,"Correlate session attributes from usage logs (duration, time-of-day, frequency) with the presence of anomaly alerts to identify high-risk session types, such as very long showers or bulk cleaning events that tend to trigger abnormal usage patterns.",3,"Profiles session types associated with anomalies."
Effectiveness of auto-shutoff or alert policies,Compare historical usage logs before and after implementation of auto-shutoff or anomaly alerts; a reduction in the number or length of sessions that coincide with anomaly events indicates effective mitigation of abnormal usage.,2,"Policy efficacy with limited personal detail."
Ranking fixtures by anomaly impact on user experience,"Use the overlap between anomaly alerts and active sessions to count how many user sessions are disrupted by anomalies at each fixture, ranking fixtures not only by anomaly count but by how often alerts interfere with normal use.",3,"Quantifies disruptions to user sessions."
Correlation between long-duration sessions and anomalies,Analyze how anomaly frequency changes across bins of session duration from the usage logs; a strong increase in anomaly rate for very long sessions reveals that extended continuous use is a key driver of abnormal patterns.,3,"Links long sessions to anomaly likelihood."
Detection of anomalous bursts between normal sessions,"Find anomaly alerts that occur in the gaps between logged sessions rather than inside them; such alerts likely represent unlogged or automated flow episodes, hinting at scheduling bugs, leaks, or unauthorized usage.",3,"Highlights unlogged bursts during gaps; reveals absence windows."
Alert escalation rules based on session context,"Use the presence or absence of an overlapping usage session to decide alert severity: anomalies during normal logged use may warrant a warning-level notification, while anomalies with no usage logs active may trigger urgent alerts or automatic shutoff.",2,"Contextual severity tuning; modest exposure."
Improving anomaly detection thresholds using log patterns,"Compare the distribution of session durations and frequencies (from usage logs) with the timing of anomaly alerts; if many ordinary sessions never produce alerts, thresholds may be conservative, whereas frequent alerts during typical sessions suggest thresholds are too tight.",2,"Threshold tuning using session context; low identity risk."
Identification of mis-logged or missing sessions,"Anomaly alerts that consistently occur at times when there are clear signs of water use (e.g., repeated patterns of similar anomalies) but no corresponding usage log sessions indicate logging failures or misconfiguration in the session tracking logic.",3,"Implies unlogged usage periods; occupancy signal."
User segment anomaly exposure analysis,"If usage logs are tagged by user or room, correlate those tags with anomaly alerts to understand which users or rooms are most frequently affected by anomalous events, guiding targeted education or hardware upgrades.",5,"Directly ties anomalies to identifiable users/rooms."
Short-session anomaly pattern detection,"Identify anomaly alerts that occur within very short usage sessions; this suggests that even brief uses sometimes push the system into abnormal states, potentially revealing oversensitive anomaly criteria or extreme user behaviors.",3,"Shows issues during quick uses; links to user behavior."
Anomaly-triggered session termination patterns,Check whether usage sessions often end shortly after an anomaly alert; frequent coincidence of alert and immediate session termination suggests that alerts prompt users to stop usage quickly.,4,"Captures user responsiveness timing to alerts."
Distinguishing systemic issues from user-specific behavior,"Compare anomaly rates across different users or rooms normalized by session counts; uniformly high rates across users suggest systemic problems, while localized high rates indicate specific user behavior or fixture-level issues.",4,"Profiles users/rooms by anomaly rate."
Early-warning indicator from rising anomaly-to-session ratio,"Track the ratio of anomaly alerts to total sessions over time; a rising ratio, even if absolute anomalies remain low, can act as an early-warning signal for emerging issues in plumbing or system configuration.",2,"Aggregated ratio trend with low personal detail."
Linking anomaly clusters to maintenance history windows,"Align periods of high anomaly counts with maintenance logs inferred from drops in usage or known interventions; if anomalies recur soon after maintenance, the fix may have been incomplete or misdirected.",2,"Maintenance correlation; minimal behavioral info."
Usage pattern shifts after major anomalies,"After a high-impact anomaly event (e.g., multiple alerts in a short time window), examine subsequent usage logs to see if users reduce long sessions or reschedule heavy uses, indicating behavioral adaptation triggered by the anomaly experience.",3,"Shows routine changes post-anomaly."
Contextual anomaly suppression during known heavy-use events,"For predictable heavy-use periods visible in usage logs (such as scheduled cleaning), anomaly alerts that consistently coincide with these intervals can be down-weighted or suppressed, while anomalies outside such contexts remain high priority.",2,"Context-aware suppression tied to schedule, modest identity exposure."
Estimating unobserved water waste from anomaly frequency,"Use the rate and timing of anomaly alerts relative to usage logs to estimate how often abnormal usage likely occurs in unlogged or poorly logged sessions, providing a rough upper bound on unobserved water waste.",3,"Estimates hidden waste, implying unlogged use windows."
