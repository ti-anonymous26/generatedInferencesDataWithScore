inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as user-present vs user-absent with flow confirmation,"Combine each flow anomaly alert window with proximity activation data and detailed flow rate history; anomalies with abnormal flow while no proximity is detected indicate likely leaks, whereas anomalies with both user presence and high flow indicate user-driven extreme usage.",4,"Presence + flow context reveals occupancy vs unattended leaks."
Leak likelihood scoring based on absence of presence during abnormal flow,"For every anomaly alert, check whether proximity shows a user nearby and confirm with flow history that water is indeed running; alerts with sustained abnormal flow and no proximity before, during, or after the event receive a high leak-likelihood score.",4,"Absence plus abnormal flow highlights leaks during idle windows."
Detection of water left running after user departure,"Identify anomaly alerts where flow history shows continued high or abnormal flow even after proximity data indicates the user has left the area, revealing fixtures left running or valves stuck open after user departure.",4,"Shows unattended flow after departure."
Distinguish crowd-driven anomalies from infrastructure failures,"When anomaly alerts align with dense clusters of proximity activations and elevated flow, anomalies are more likely driven by crowd use (e.g., busy public restrooms), whereas alerts with abnormal flow but no crowd presence suggest underlying infrastructure faults.",4,"Exposes crowd-related versus vacant anomalies."
Sensor coverage validation using anomalies and flow patterns,"If anomaly alerts repeatedly coincide with abnormal flow in the history but proximity rarely detects users nearby, it indicates that proximity sensors may not cover the actual user zone or that valves are actuating without in-zone presence.",2,"Sensor coverage check with limited personal detail."
Detection of unattended abnormal usage in off-hours,Cross anomaly timestamps with expected building hours inferred from proximity patterns and confirm with flow history; anomaly alerts during periods with no proximity activity and abnormal flow highlight unattended abnormal usage when the facility should be empty.,4,"Reveals off-hour abnormal flow tied to absence."
Calibration of anomaly alert severity using presence context,"Use proximity and flow data to tune the severity of each anomaly: events with abnormal flow and no proximity are given higher severity than those with abnormal flow while proximity indicates active usage, which may be legitimate high demand.",2,"Severity tuning with modest behavioral exposure."
Detection of stuck flow-control valves via presence–flow mismatch,"Anomalies where flow remains high in the history while proximity toggles between present and absent or remains absent suggest a mechanically stuck valve, as water continues to run regardless of whether users are present.",3,"Infers mechanical fault from presence/flow mismatch."
Identification of sensor obstruction during anomalous flow,"If anomaly alerts show abnormal flow patterns during times when users are almost certainly present (e.g., from other fixtures’ proximity), but the affected fixture’s proximity sensor never triggers, this suggests that the sensor is obstructed or misaligned.",2,"Highlights sensor obstruction; low personal risk."
Anomaly-triggered user intervention detection,"Within anomaly windows, look for a sudden burst of proximity activity followed by a drop in abnormal flow in the history; this pattern indicates that users noticed abnormal behavior and intervened to shut off or adjust the fixture.",3,"Shows user response timing to anomalies."
Detection of ghost anomalies from system noise,"Anomaly alerts that show brief abnormal flow spikes in the history with no proximity before, during, or after the event and no persistence of abnormal behavior are likely due to sensor noise or transient measurement errors rather than real issues.",1,"Noise/glitch labeling with negligible personal data."
Anomaly clustering by presence pattern (single user vs crowd),"Cluster anomaly events based on whether they occur during single long proximity sessions or many short overlapping activations; single-user anomalies may relate to specific behaviors, while crowd anomalies suggest capacity or control issues under group use.",3,"Groups anomalies by presence pattern, moderate profiling."
Early detection of persistent background leaks,"Repeated anomaly alerts with low but non-zero abnormal flow in the history, consistently occurring when proximity indicates no presence, reveal persistent background leaks that do not depend on user interaction.",4,"Unattended leak detection tied to absence windows."
Optimization of presence-based auto-shutoff policies under anomalies,"During anomaly periods, compare the timing of last proximity detection with the time abnormal flow ceases; if flow continues long after presence ends, auto-shutoff delays should be shortened for those fixtures to mitigate abnormal use.",2,"Policy tuning using presence/flow timing."
Segregating user-misuse anomalies from mechanical failures,"Events with abnormal flow where proximity shows extended or unusual user presence patterns (e.g., long hovering, repeated activations) suggest misuse (e.g., deliberately blocking sensors), whereas abnormal flow without meaningful presence favors mechanical failure hypotheses.",3,"Differentiates misuse vs mechanical fault using presence."
Security anomaly detection from combined presence and abnormal flow,"Flow anomaly alerts during times when proximity indicates unexpected presence (e.g., at night or in restricted areas) signal potential security incidents such as vandalism or unauthorized use of fixtures.",4,"Flags off-hours presence with abnormal flow; high security sensitivity."
Presence-informed anomaly suppression for known cleaning operations,"If cleaning routines involve long, high-flow usage with continuous presence patterns, anomaly alerts that match these known presence–flow signatures can be suppressed or downgraded while still monitoring for leaks when presence is absent.",2,"Context-based suppression; limited personal detail."
Detection of repeated approach–trigger–anomaly cycles,"Identify sequences where proximity shows a user approaching, flow spikes abnormally with an anomaly alert, and the user quickly leaves. Repeated cycles of this pattern indicate a fixture that consistently misbehaves under normal user interaction.",3,"Captures repeated user aborts linked to anomalies."
Anomaly-driven stress testing of proximity-based UX,"During anomalies where flow is unstable, monitor proximity patterns to see if users repeatedly move hands or bodies to try to stop abnormal flow; this reveals how well the proximity-based interface supports or frustrates users when failures occur.",3,"Shows user interaction patterns during failure."
Occupancy-normalized anomaly rate estimation,Normalize anomaly counts and associated abnormal flow volumes by the total presence time recorded by proximity sensors; high anomaly-per-presence ratios indicate fixtures with disproportionate abnormal behavior relative to how often they are actually used.,2,"Aggregate rate metric with limited identity."
Detection of unmonitored remote activation under anomalies,"If flow anomaly alerts occur with abnormal flow while no proximity is recorded and there is no expectation of human presence, the system can infer that valves may be actuated remotely or by faulty automation rather than direct user interaction.",3,"Reveals remote/automation activation during absence."
Presence-aware ranking of anomaly repair priority,"Combine abnormal volume from flow history, presence frequency, and number of anomalies per fixture. Fixtures that frequently experience abnormal flow without presence and those that disrupt many presence episodes both rank higher for repair priority.",2,"Repair prioritization using aggregated presence/flow."
Differentiation of emergency shutoff vs user-driven resolution,"For each anomaly event, analyze whether abnormal flow stops immediately after system-triggered shutoff or only after new proximity activity; the latter indicates that resolution depends on user action rather than automatic protections.",3,"Shows whether resolution requires user action."
Self-resolving anomaly pattern detection,"Anomalies with abnormal flow that return to normal without any intervening proximity signals point to transient system states (e.g., brief pressure glitches) that self-resolve but are still worth monitoring if they become frequent.",2,"Self-resolving system behavior; minimal personal info."
Detection of valves that reopen after users leave,"Observe anomalies where abnormal flow stops while proximity is present but resumes after presence ends, generating another alert. This indicates valves that intermittently reopen without user interaction, needing mechanical inspection.",4,"Exposes unintended flow restarting post-departure."
Quantifying user disruption from anomaly events,"For anomalies overlapping with proximity presence, calculate how much presence time coincides with abnormal flow; higher overlap indicates greater user disruption and may justify more aggressive mitigation strategies for those fixtures.",3,"Measures disruption to users during anomalies."
Identification of fixtures prone to anomaly under heavy presence,"Using combined flow, presence, and alert data, identify fixtures where anomaly frequency scales sharply with presence duration; these fixtures may be particularly sensitive to sustained usage and require robust hardware or configuration changes.",3,"Profiles fixtures sensitive to heavy presence."
Segmentation of anomalies by typical presence pattern,"Cluster anomalies into categories such as no-presence leaks, single-user events, and crowd-related anomalies based on proximity patterns and associated flow signatures, aiding targeted root-cause analysis for each type.",3,"Categorizes anomalies using presence patterns; moderate profiling."
Predictive identification of high-risk no-presence periods,"Analyze historical anomalies that occurred during specific no-presence periods (e.g., late nights) and abnormal flow shapes; similar conditions in the future can be flagged as high-risk windows for potential leaks even before new anomalies occur.",4,"Predicts leak-prone absent windows."
Testing effectiveness of presence-based lockout policies,"If policies require presence before water can flow, anomaly events showing abnormal flow with no proximity indicate policy violations or bypasses, while a decline in such events after policy tuning confirms improved enforcement.",3,"Assesses policy enforcement using presence/flow."
Dynamic anomaly thresholds informed by presence-driven usage patterns,"Use long-term correlations between presence duration and normal flow to set context-aware anomaly thresholds; for example, allow higher flow during periods of intense presence and tighten thresholds when presence is rare, reducing false positives.",2,"Threshold tuning via presence patterns; low identity risk."
