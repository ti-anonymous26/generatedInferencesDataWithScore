Time-of-day comfort behavior under active presence,"Combine usage log timestamps with proximity presence windows and temperature trends to see what temperatures users actually choose at different times of day when they are physically at the fixture, distinguishing real comfort behavior from idle temperature values.",4,"Reveals comfort choices tied to daily schedule."
Per-session comfort profile with verified presence,"For each usage session, intersect its duration (from logs) with periods of continuous proximity and analyze the temperature within that overlap to derive a comfort profile (e.g., 10-minute evening shower at 38–40°C with user present throughout).",4,"Builds detailed comfort profile per session."
Pre-use waiting time for warm water,Use proximity activation before the official session start in usage logs and the temperature trend to measure how long users stand near the fixture while temperature ramps from cold to their usual comfort range before they fully start the session.,3,"Shows wait time and start-of-use behavior."
Post-use lingering near warm fixtures,"Identify periods where a usage log session has ended and no flow is occurring, yet proximity shows the user still nearby while temperature trends remain elevated, suggesting post-use grooming or use of residual warmth.",3,"Captures post-use lingering habits."
Differentiating quick checks from full sessions,"Short proximity bursts with brief, small changes in temperature and no or minimal session duration in usage logs indicate quick temperature checks, whereas longer sessions with sustained temperature and presence indicate actual handwashing or showering.",3,"Separates quick checks from full use, mapping behavior."
Session-type classification (sink vs shower) with presence and temperature,"Long sessions in the logs with continuous proximity and stable warm temperatures point to showers, while shorter, intermittent proximity with modest temperatures and brief durations corresponds more to sink usage, helping distinguish fixture use types in combined systems.",4,"Identifies use type (sink vs shower) tied to routines."
Two-phase shower behavior under continuous presence,"Within long usage sessions that show continuous proximity, detect a hot, possibly lower-flow wash phase followed by a slightly cooler temperature phase, confirming structured routines like washing then rinsing under sustained user presence.",4,"Exposes structured in-shower phases."
Seasonal variation in presence-linked comfort settings,"Compare, by season, the temperature ranges users choose during presence-confirmed portions of sessions with similar durations in usage logs, revealing how comfort settings shift across warmer and colder months.",3,"Shows seasonal comfort shifts linked to presence."
User tolerance to temperature ramp-up time,"For each session, measure the time from the first proximity activation to when temperature reaches the user’s typical comfort band; correlate that delay with whether the session continues or is aborted early in the usage log, estimating user tolerance to slow warm-up.",3,"Reveals tolerance for slow warm-up."
Detection of child-associated safe-temperature presence patterns,"Use proximity patterns that imply lower height or shorter presence intervals, combined with usage logs and consistently moderate temperatures (e.g., not exceeding 37–38°C), to infer child usage and ensure temperatures remain within safer bands during those sessions.",5,"Infers child presence and safety-related temps."
"Identification of high-comfort, high-energy routines","Find recurring sessions in the usage logs where proximity is continuous and temperature stays high for long durations, revealing routines that are strongly comfort-oriented but also energy-intensive, like nightly long hot showers.",4,"Profiles energy-heavy comfort routines."
Detecting inefficient preheating with user present,"Locate log sessions where users remain near the fixture (proximity) while temperature remains below the comfort range for a large portion of the session duration, indicating that water is being run while the user is waiting rather than using warm water effectively.",3,"Shows inefficient waiting behavior."
Efficient intermittent-use behavior detection,"Within a usage session, find segments where proximity is sustained but temperature remains within the comfort band while the user cycles water on and off (reflected in short active spans in the logs), indicating efficient use where water is off during non-essential periods.",3,"Captures efficient on/off habits."
Comfort stability index per session,"For each usage session, during continuous proximity periods, compute the variance of temperature; low variance indicates stable comfort conditions while the user is present, whereas high variance suggests frequent manual adjustments or unstable mixing.",3,"Measures stability of personal comfort during use."
Detection of thermal shock-induced session termination,"Find sessions where, under continuous proximity and flow, temperature suddenly deviates far from the comfort range and the session ends soon afterward in the logs, indicating that a thermal shock likely caused the user to stop the session.",4,"Links thermal shock to immediate session end."
Ritualized temperature-setting routines,"Sessions that begin with a recognizable pattern—proximity appears, user quickly adjusts temperature up and down before stabilizing, then proceeds with a steady-temperature period—indicate ritualized sequences users follow to dial in a precise comfort setting.",4,"Identifies ritualized adjustment sequences."
Distinguishing cleaning tasks from personal hygiene via tri-signal patterns,"Usage logs with irregular durations, proximity that is intermittent or involves movement across the sensor, and temperatures that are often cooler or variable reveal cleaning behavior, as opposed to the consistent presence and warmer constant temperatures typical of showers.",4,"Infers cleaning vs hygiene activities."
Detection of presence during idle hot-water conditions,"Identify intervals where temperature remains elevated from recent use, flow is off, and proximity logs show people near the fixture during or between sessions; these patterns can indicate users evaluating water conditions before starting new usage.",3,"Shows presence around idle hot water between uses."
Comfort-pattern clustering across users without explicit IDs,"Cluster sessions using attributes from logs (time and duration), temperature profiles while proximity is active, and presence patterns (continuous vs intermittent) to infer distinct user comfort profiles even when the system does not track user identity directly.",5,"Enables user profiling/re-identification via comfort patterns."
Time-resolved comfort drift within long sessions,"Within long sessions that keep users present, track gradual changes in temperature over time, such as users lowering temperature mid-session, revealing how comfort needs evolve across a single extended use (e.g., starting hot, ending cooler).",3,"Shows evolving comfort preferences within sessions."
Detection of ‘test and assist’ supervision patterns,"Short proximity episodes at the beginning of a session, coinciding with temperature adjustments, followed by longer presence intervals suggest a supervising person briefly tests and sets temperature before leaving the primary user at the fixture.",4,"Infers supervision/assistance patterns."
Weekday vs weekend comfort and presence comparison,"Using session dates in the logs, compare weekend and weekday sessions with respect to presence duration and stable temperature ranges; longer presence and higher temperatures on weekends indicate more relaxed, comfort-focused routines.",3,"Shows schedule-driven comfort differences."
Identification of brief hot-water safety checks,"Very short sessions in the logs that occur with brief proximity spikes and temperature quickly touching a high level, then turning off, indicate safety checks (e.g., a user briefly testing how hot the water gets) rather than full use.",3,"Identifies quick hot safety checks."
Estimating fair use in shared spaces through comfort-aware presence,"In shared bathrooms, compare per-session presence time from proximity, stable comfort temperatures from trends, and session durations from logs to estimate how much comfortable shower or faucet time each person likely receives, without tracking identity explicitly.",5,"Infers per-person comfort time without explicit IDs."
Comfort-preserving temperature cap evaluation,"After introducing a maximum temperature cap, compare presence-linked temperature patterns and session durations; if proximity durations and session lengths remain stable while peak temperatures drop, the cap successfully improves safety without reducing comfort time.",2,"Policy impact with limited personal detail."
"Detection of short, hot, high-risk child sessions","Find sessions with brief durations in the logs, short presence (from proximity), and high peak temperatures that approach scald-risk levels, indicating potential safety issues for short uses that may involve children or quick but risky tasks.",5,"Flags potential child exposure to high temps."
Identification of presence-only grooming near lukewarm water,"Presence with low or no recorded session duration and temperatures hovering around lukewarm values suggests grooming behaviors (e.g., brushing teeth) near the sink without substantial water flow, differentiating them from full washing or showering.",3,"Reveals grooming near fixture without full use."
Adaptive recommendation of start temperature for different times of day,"For common time slots derived from usage logs, analyze the temperature ranges users maintain while present and suggest or auto-set start temperatures appropriate for those times, reducing adjustment during the early part of presence.",3,"Predicts preferred start temps by time, profiling habits."
Comfort adaptation after seasonal heater adjustments,"When system heater setpoints change seasonally, observe how presence-linked temperature patterns and session durations evolve; stable or slightly shifting comfort ranges under similar presence durations indicate successful adaptation to new thermal conditions.",2,"Seasonal adaptation insight with coarse identity."
