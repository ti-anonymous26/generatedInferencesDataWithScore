inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as in-session versus out-of-session events,"Align each flow anomaly alert with usage log intervals and inspect the detailed flow rate history; anomalies that occur fully inside a logged session are likely intense but user-driven, while anomalies outside any session with abnormal flow indicate leaks or unlogged system behavior.",3,"Labels anomalies relative to sessions, exposing occupancy intervals and routine usage patterns."
Leak likelihood scoring with session and flow context,"For every anomaly alert, check whether a usage log session overlaps with the alert and examine the flow rate pattern. Alerts without overlapping sessions and with sustained abnormal flow receive a high leak-likelihood score, while alerts inside sessions with typical flow curves score lower.",3,"Crosses anomalies with session overlaps to judge leaks, revealing when and how users run water."
Detection of forgotten or stuck-on fixtures,"Identify usage log sessions that extend far beyond typical duration while flow history remains high and anomaly alerts fire during the tail of the session, indicating taps or showers left running unintentionally or valves stuck in an open position.",4,"Flags excessively long sessions implying forgetfulness or unattended use, directly reflecting user behavior."
Severity ranking of anomalies by abnormal volume within sessions,"For each anomaly alert that overlaps a usage session, integrate the flow rate above normal for the duration of the alert to determine the extra water volume consumed, enabling ranking of in-session anomalies by their actual excess usage.",3,"Ranks extra volume within sessions, tying abnormal consumption to specific user activity levels."
Detection of ghost anomalies caused by logging gaps,"When anomaly alerts coincide with clearly abnormal flow in the history but no usage log session exists for that period, this suggests logging failures or untracked usage paths. Repeated ghost anomalies pinpoint gaps in session logging or unauthorized usage.",3,"Finds anomalies without session logs, hinting at unrecorded usage or presence during supposed inactivity."
User response time to high-severity anomalies,"For anomalies that overlap with usage sessions and represent high abnormal flow, measure the time from anomaly onset in flow history to the end of the session in the logs. Shorter response times indicate users quickly react to alerts or visible abnormal behavior.",4,"Measures reaction time from alert to session end, indicating individual attentiveness and responsiveness."
Pattern-based identification of anomalous session types,"Analyze session attributes (duration and frequency from logs), coupled with how often they trigger anomaly alerts and the shapes of their flow history, to identify specific session types—such as very long showers or heavy cleaning—that are prone to abnormal usage.",4,"Profiles session types prone to anomalies, surfacing habit patterns like long showers or cleaning."
Daypart-specific anomaly risk modeling,"Combine time-of-day information from usage logs with anomaly frequency and corresponding flow rate patterns to model which parts of the day, under which usage levels, produce the greatest risk of abnormal water use or failures.",3,"Models risk by time of day and usage level, revealing daily routines and occupancy windows."
Differentiation between heavy-use and failure anomalies,"When anomaly alerts occur during long or high-flow sessions indicated by logs, inspect the detailed flow profile. Smooth, sustained high flow suggests intentional heavy use, while irregular surges within a normal-length session point toward a failure or misconfiguration.",3,"Distinguishes intentional heavy use from failures via flow shapes, modestly reflecting use intensity."
Infrastructure capacity stress detection during peak sessions,Identify periods where multiple usage sessions overlap in the logs and total flow approaches or exceeds nominal capacity. Frequent anomaly alerts during these periods indicate system stress under peak demand that may require infrastructure upgrades.,2,"Checks overlapping sessions stressing capacity, mostly operational without user-level detail."
Vacation or away-mode anomaly detection,"Use usage logs to find multi-day windows with little or no sessions; any anomaly alerts within these windows, especially with non-zero flow in the history, are strong indicators of leaks or failures happening while the premises are unoccupied.",5,"Detects anomalies during prolonged absence, clearly exposing occupancy or away status."
Progressive degradation before major failures,Track sequences where small anomaly alerts with modest abnormal flow gradually increase in frequency or severity across sessions in the logs. This trend suggests progressive wear or deterioration preceding a major failure event.,2,"Tracks rising anomaly severity over time, primarily equipment health with little personal detail."
Evaluation of anomaly detection precision against flow and logs,"Compare anomaly alerts with the underlying flow histories and corresponding sessions; alerts that coincide with normal-looking flow in typical sessions represent false positives, guiding refinement of detection rules.",2,"Compares alerts to normal flow to find false positives; mainly model quality, low personal exposure."
Evaluation of anomaly detection recall using flow history,"Scan the flow rate history for abnormal patterns similar to those seen in alerted anomalies but lacking any corresponding alerts. When cross-referenced with sessions, these missed events highlight where anomaly detection failed despite clear abnormal in-session or out-of-session usage.",2,"Looks for missed abnormal flows, focused on detection gaps rather than user behavior."
Anomaly impact scoring per fixture or zone,"Aggregate anomalies per fixture or zone, combining abnormal volumes derived from flow history with the number of affected usage sessions in the logs. This yields an impact score that ranks fixtures by how often and how severely they experience abnormal usage.",3,"Aggregates impact per fixture/zone, mildly revealing which locations see heavy abnormal use."
Short-session anomaly detection,"Identify anomalies that occur within very short sessions in the logs. These events, visible in the flow history as sharp spikes or surges, may indicate extreme behavior or sensitive thresholds, requiring special handling distinct from long-session anomalies.",3,"Flags anomalies in very short sessions, highlighting unusual quick-use behavior."
Contextual escalation rules for anomaly alerts,"Use the presence of a concurrent usage session and the abnormal flow magnitude to determine escalation level: anomalies with large abnormal flow and no session in logs trigger auto-shutoff, while anomalies during routine high-demand sessions may only require warnings.",3,"Sets escalation based on session presence and flow magnitude, inferring when users are active."
Detection of unlogged continuous abnormal flows between sessions,"Search for anomaly alerts with abnormal flow that bridge the gaps between logged sessions, indicating continuous abnormal usage that persists through idle periods and may be invisible if only sessions are monitored.",3,"Finds abnormal flows bridging idle periods, indicating unexpected activity between sessions."
Maintenance prioritization based on anomaly-to-usage ratio,"For each fixture, compute the ratio of anomaly alerts to total session hours from the logs, weighted by abnormal flow volume from history. High ratios with large abnormal volumes indicate fixtures that should be prioritized for inspection or replacement.",2,"Ranks fixtures by anomaly-to-usage ratio, mostly maintenance prioritization with limited personal detail."
Behavioral change after major anomalies,"Compare session patterns (duration and frequency), flow characteristics, and subsequent anomaly rates before and after major anomaly events. If users shorten sessions or avoid high-flow periods after an incident, it suggests behavioral adaptation triggered by the anomaly.",4,"Compares pre/post anomaly session habits, explicitly tracking behavioral changes."
Detection of policy enforcement gaps,"When usage policies limit session duration or total daily usage, anomalies aligned with sessions that violate these constraints and show high abnormal flow highlight where policy enforcement or user education is failing.",4,"Surfaces sessions violating duration or usage policies, exposing compliance and potential misuse."
Session-end anomaly association,"Check how often anomaly alerts occur just before the end of sessions in the usage logs. A high frequency suggests that visible abnormal behavior (e.g., spray irregularity) is prompting users to manually stop the session.",3,"Counts alerts near session end, hinting at user reactions to issues."
System resilience assessment under extreme sessions,"Analyze sessions at the high end of duration and total flow. If these extreme sessions rarely generate anomaly alerts and flow patterns remain stable, the system is resilient under intense use; frequent anomalies indicate the opposite.",2,"Assesses anomalies during extreme sessions, primarily system resilience with minimal personal info."
Temporal clustering of anomalies around cleaning routines,"If usage logs reveal regular cleaning windows (many long or high-flow sessions clustered), check whether anomaly alerts cluster in these periods with characteristic flow patterns. This reveals whether cleaning tasks push the system into abnormal operation.",4,"Clusters anomalies around cleaning windows, revealing routine cleaning schedules."
Detection of water hammer or pressure shocks during sessions,"Within sessions that trigger anomaly alerts, inspect flow history for very rapid spikes or oscillations superimposed on otherwise normal flow. These patterns suggest water hammer events impacting both user experience and infrastructure health.",2,"Detects pressure shocks within sessions, technical pattern with little behavioral insight."
Verification of automatic shutoff based on anomaly events,"For anomalies that should trigger auto-shutoff, check whether flow in the history quickly returns to baseline and the usage log session ends soon after the alert. Persistent flow and ongoing session entries reveal failures in shutoff logic.",2,"Checks flow drop after auto-shutoff during sessions, mostly system control with minor behavior cues."
"Classification of anomalies into leak, burst, or user-misuse types","Combine abnormal flow shapes (history), timing relative to sessions (logs), and the alert metadata to categorize anomalies as slow leaks (low, long flows without sessions), bursts (sudden high peaks possibly during or outside sessions), or misuse (extreme in-session behavior).",4,"Categorizes anomalies and can attribute misuse to user behavior alongside leak detection."
Long-term anomaly trend analysis normalized by usage,Examine anomaly frequency over time while normalizing by total session hours from usage logs. A rising anomaly-per-hour trend indicates worsening system health even if total water use or session count changes.,2,"Trends anomalies normalized by usage hours, aggregated system health not tied to individuals."
Detection of misconfigured or overly tight anomaly thresholds,"Frequent anomaly alerts during normal-looking flow patterns within typical sessions, especially when abnormal volumes are small, indicate that thresholds are too tight and should be relaxed to avoid alert fatigue.",2,"Finds frequent alerts during normal sessions, mainly tuning thresholds; minimal personal exposure."
Detection of overly loose anomaly thresholds,"If substantial abnormal flow segments are visible in the flow history within sessions but seldom produce alerts, and corresponding sessions are much longer or more intense than baseline, thresholds are too loose and need tightening.",2,"Spots large abnormal flows without alerts, focused on detection gaps rather than user identity."
Estimating hidden water loss from unlogged anomalies,"For anomalies that occur outside of any usage log sessions, integrate abnormal flow and compare with total daily usage; this proportion indicates how much of water loss is not tied to normal user behavior and would be hidden without anomaly monitoring.",3,"Estimates unlogged water loss outside sessions, revealing possible off-record use or occupancy."
Mapping anomalies to user groups or zones via session tags,"If usage logs are tagged with user, room, or zone information, associate anomalies to those tags based on overlapping sessions and flow patterns. This reveals which groups or zones are associated with more frequent or severe abnormal usage.",5,"Links anomalies to specific users or zones, directly associating abnormal events with people/places."
Event reconstruction during multi-session anomaly windows,"When anomalies overlap with multiple sessions and complex flow patterns, reconstruct their sequence by aligning alert timestamps, flow spikes, and individual session boundaries to understand which session or fixture initiated the abnormal event.",4,"Reconstructs overlapping events, potentially tying anomalies to specific users or precise times."
Cross-validation of manual maintenance reports,"Compare technician-reported incidents with windows of anomalies in the alert logs, abnormal flow segments, and unusual session patterns. Consistent alignment validates reports, while discrepancies suggest missing or misdated incident records.",2,"Matches anomalies with maintenance reports, operational cross-check with limited behavior detail."
Tailored user feedback on high-risk behavior,"Identify specific sessions where user-driven behavior (long duration, high flow) consistently corresponds with anomaly alerts. Aggregate these by user or fixture (if tagged in logs) to deliver targeted feedback about risky or wasteful usage patterns.",5,"Targets feedback to users showing risky patterns, clearly profiling individual behavior."
Automated detection of scheduler or automation misbehavior,"If system automations can open valves outside normal usage patterns, anomalies that recur at scheduled times without any corresponding session entries and with abnormal flow provide evidence that automation is misconfigured or malfunctioning.",2,"Flags automation-triggered anomalies on schedules, exposing system programming more than personal behavior."
Verification of successful repairs using post-maintenance data,"After maintenance, compare the frequency and severity of anomaly alerts, their flow signatures, and associated session patterns with pre-maintenance metrics. A significant reduction, especially for the same session types, indicates effective repairs.",2,"Compares anomalies before and after repairs, maintenance effectiveness with minimal user insight."
Resilience of usage patterns despite anomalies,"If users continue to run sessions with similar duration and flow after repeated anomalies, and anomaly severity stays constant, it suggests that anomalies are either not visible to users or not disruptive, informing whether user-facing alerts need redesign.",3,"Checks if users keep the same usage after anomalies, monitoring behavioral resilience."
Predictive identification of high-risk upcoming sessions,"Model the relationship between session parameters in usage logs (duration, start time, historical flow characteristics) and the likelihood of anomalies. For new sessions whose early flow patterns match historically high-risk profiles, the system can pre-emptively monitor more aggressively or warn users.",4,"Predicts which upcoming sessions are risky, inferring near-future user behavior and timing."
