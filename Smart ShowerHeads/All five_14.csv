inference,Description,score,short rationale
Full-context classification of anomalies as user-present sessions vs unattended leaks,"For each flow anomaly alert, align it with usage log sessions, flow rate history, temperature trends, and proximity data; alerts that overlap active sessions, continuous flow, stable comfort-range temperatures, and presence indicate user-present abnormal use, while alerts with sustained flow, elevated or stable temperatures, no session, and no presence indicate unattended leaks.",4,"Full stack of signals separates occupancy vs absence during anomalies, revealing when people are present."
Leak likelihood scoring using multi-signal absence and warm flow,"Score anomaly alerts by checking for lack of overlapping usage sessions and proximity, combined with sustained non-zero flow and temperatures above cold baseline in the flow history; the combination of warm continuous flow, no session, and no presence yields very high leak-likelihood.",4,"Warm continuous flow without sessions/presence signals leaks during absence."
Detection of hot-water leaks that begin after normal sessions end,"Find cases where a normal-looking usage session ends in the logs and proximity disappears, but shortly afterward a flow anomaly alert fires while the flow history shows continuous warm flow and no new session; this pattern reveals post-use valve failures causing hot-water leaks.",4,"Catches warm flow continuing after users leave, exposing absence periods."
Scalding-risk anomaly episodes inside active sessions under presence,"During usage sessions with confirmed proximity and significant flow, flag anomaly alerts where temperature spikes above a configured scald threshold; this combination identifies dangerous events where users are directly exposed to excessively hot water.",4,"Directly links unsafe temperatures to present users."
Cold-shock anomalies that cause session interruption,"Within sessions, detect anomaly alerts where flow conditions change and temperature rapidly drops below the user’s typical comfort band while proximity is active, followed by early session termination in the logs; this reveals cold-shock events that drive users to stop using the fixture.",4,"Tracks cold shocks that make users stop sessions, reflecting individual reactions."
Energy footprint of anomaly events relative to total daily use,"For each anomaly alert, integrate abnormal flow from the flow history and weight it by temperature elevation over baseline, then compare this energy to total session-based hot-water use from logs; this shows what fraction of daily energy use is due to abnormal, presence-tagged or unattended events.",3,"Quantifies abnormal energy share per day tied to specific anomaly windows."
"Session-type-specific anomaly profiling (e.g., long evening showers)","Group usage sessions by type, such as long evening showers or short handwashing, using logs and proximity patterns, then analyze which groups overlap the most anomaly alerts with significant flow and temperature deviations; this reveals which routines are most prone to abnormal usage.",4,"Associates anomalies with particular routines/times, profiling user habits."
Detection of users running showers primarily to heat the room,"Identify sessions where flow history shows sustained high flow and warm temperatures, but proximity logs show intermittent or low presence after an initial setup period, combined with occasional anomaly alerts; this pattern suggests water is being used to heat the room rather than for continuous bathing.",4,"Reveals intentional hot-water use without presence, indicating non-hygiene behavior."
"Child-safe anomaly escalation based on height, temperature, and session context","When anomaly alerts occur in sessions with presence patterns indicative of children (shorter height or shorter stays), elevated or rapidly changing temperatures, and moderate to high flow, automatically escalate alerts and consider emergency shutoff since a vulnerable user is likely involved.",5,"Infers child involvement during risky temperatures, highly sensitive."
Differentiating infrastructure failures from user misuse anomalies,Compare anomaly alerts where abnormal flow persists without sessions or presence (infrastructure failures) to alerts where abnormal flow and extreme temperatures occur during long sessions with continuous presence and repeated user adjustments (misuse); the multi-signal patterns support clear categorization.,3,"Separates leaks/failures from misuse, implying user-driven extremes."
Crowd-driven anomaly identification in multi-fixture environments,"Use usage logs and proximity to detect periods of many overlapping short sessions and dense presence, then correlate with spikes in total flow history and clustered anomaly alerts; this reveals anomalies arising from crowd-induced peak demand and pressure variations.",4,"Exposes crowding periods and co-occupancy patterns linked to anomalies."
Detection of partially logged abnormal usage segments,"When anomaly alerts coincide with continuous flow and shifting temperatures and proximity confirms users nearby, but usage logs only record a fragment of this period as a session, the system can infer that some abnormal usage is occurring without complete session logging.",4,"Identifies unlogged usage with presence/flow/temperature, revealing unrecorded activity."
Verification and tuning of anomaly thresholds using normal session envelopes,"Construct normal envelopes of flow and temperature trajectories for each session type from logs, filtered to presence-validated periods; anomaly alerts that fall entirely within these envelopes indicate thresholds are too tight, while clearly abnormal segments without alerts show thresholds are too loose.",2,"Threshold calibration against typical sessions; low personal exposure."
Water hammer/pressure shock detection with user impact tagging,"Flow anomaly alerts that mark extremely short, sharp spikes in flow, with brief temperature jitter and simultaneous proximity during active sessions, are tagged as pressure shocks; the presence and session context determine whether these shocks likely impact users or occur off-line.",2,"Technical spike tagging; presence only flags impact, limited behavioral detail."
Seasonal anomaly pattern analysis normalized by usage and presence,"Across seasons, compare anomaly rates per unit of session time, flow volume, and presence time, while examining temperature behavior; higher rates of hot anomalies in winter under similar usage and presence suggest that seasonal heating demands increase abnormal stress on the system.",2,"Seasonal aggregate trends using coarse presence, low sensitivity."
Detection of cleaning-driven anomalies vs leak-driven anomalies,"Cleaning windows exhibit many short, irregular sessions, moving proximity around fixtures, oscillating flow rates, and moderate temperatures; anomaly alerts with these signatures represent cleaning-driven stress, whereas alerts with steady warm flow, no sessions, and no presence point to leaks.",3,"Distinguishes cleaning activity from leaks, revealing maintenance routines."
Recovery time after severe anomalies including user experience,"For severe anomaly alerts with large abnormal flow, strong presence, and extreme temperatures in a session, measure how many subsequent sessions (with their own flow, temperature, and presence patterns) are needed before behavior reverts to normal; long recovery times indicate lingering system or user trust issues.",3,"Tracks post-incident behavior and system recovery, showing adaptation."
Prioritization of fixtures by anomaly severity and user disruption,"For each fixture, combine anomaly frequency, abnormal flow volume and flow shape, temperature deviation, and proportion of alerts overlapping presence and sessions; fixtures with many high-volume, extreme-temperature, user-present anomalies are top priority for maintenance or redesign.",3,"Ranks fixtures by user-impacting anomalies, implying where people are affected."
Detection of recirculation or automation misbehavior during idle periods,"Anomalies that occur with low, pulsed flow in the history, moderate or warm temperatures, no sessions in the logs, and no presence indicate that recirculation pumps or automated routines are inadvertently generating abnormal water movement when the system is otherwise idle.",2,"Idle automation issues without presence; minimal behavioral linkage."
Behavioral adaptation to repeated anomalies,"After periods with many anomaly alerts overlapping sessions and presence, examine changes in later sessions’ flow volumes, temperatures, and durations; shorter sessions or cautious temperature choices, particularly at times previously associated with anomalies, imply user adaptation to perceived risk.",4,"Monitors behavior changes in response to anomalies, profiling user caution."
Context-aware dynamic anomaly thresholding by occupancy and routine,"Use historical correlations among anomaly alerts, flow histories, temperature trends, usage patterns, and proximity-based occupancy to set dynamic thresholds—permitting more variance during known high-demand routines and tightening thresholds in expected quiet and no-presence periods.",3,"Adjusts thresholds using occupancy/routine patterns, revealing schedules."
Detection of fixtures that only fail under specific routines,"Some fixtures may generate anomaly alerts only during a particular routine (e.g., long hot showers after work) characterized by specific session times, flow ramp patterns, presence length, and temperature behavior; identifying these routine-specific failures helps target root causes that manifest under specific conditions.",3,"Links failures to specific routines, indicating user timing and habits."
Anomaly-driven comfort disruption scoring per user-like profile,"Cluster sessions into user-like profiles based on logs, flow, temperature, and proximity behavior; then compute how often and how strongly anomaly alerts disrupt comfort within those profiles, helping to understand the impact on different user groups without explicit identity tracking.",5,"Builds user-like profiles and measures disruption, strongly profiling behavior."
Estimating unobserved structural risk from off-session anomalies,"Aggregate anomaly alerts that show sustained abnormal flow, warm or cold temperatures, no sessions, and no presence; these events do not affect active users directly but indicate structural stress and potential damage to pipes and joints over time.",2,"Focuses on off-session anomalies and system risk; low personal detail."
Validation of presence-linked safety policies under abnormal conditions,"If the system enforces stricter flow or temperature limits when presence is detected, anomaly alerts with high flow or extreme temperatures during active presence and sessions reveal cases where safety policies did not hold during abnormal events and need reinforcement.",3,"Checks safety failures while users are present, implying exposure."
Early detection of gradually worsening leaks from anomaly sequences,"Track sequences of anomaly alerts with small but increasing abnormal flow in the history and stable warm temperatures, often with no presence or sessions; a trend of increasing severity across alerts indicates that small leaks are gradually worsening before catastrophic failure.",2,"Sequences of leak-like anomalies in absence; minimal personal info."
High-risk period prediction using combined past anomaly and usage patterns,"Analyze when anomalies historically cluster in relation to session timing, flow peaks, temperature states, and occupancy; when similar patterns recur, label upcoming windows as high-risk so that the system can preemptively tighten thresholds or monitor more closely.",3,"Predicts risky windows from usage/occupancy patterns, revealing routine timing."
Detection of fixtures causing systemic pressure or thermal anomalies,"An anomaly at one fixture that coincides with flow irregularities, temperature disturbances, and presence disruptions across multiple sessions on other fixtures suggests that this fixture’s abnormal behavior is destabilizing the broader system landscape.",2,"Identifies culprit fixtures from correlated anomalies; limited personal exposure."
Quantifying fraction of each session spent in abnormal states,"Within each usage session, intersect the durations of anomaly alerts with presence and actual flow segments, and classify temperature during those moments; the ratio of abnormal-state time to total session time measures how frequently users experience anomalous conditions during their routines.",4,"Measures per-session abnormal time while present, detailing user experience."
Detecting anomalies that imply inter-fixture crosstalk or shared line issues,"When anomaly alerts for different fixtures occur concurrently or in close succession, and the flow and temperature patterns show correlated disturbances, while proximity logs show independent session activity at both fixtures, the data suggests shared line issues or pressure crosstalk in the plumbing network.",2,"Correlated fixture issues with separate users; low direct personal detail."
Testing effectiveness of automated anomaly repairs or resets,"After a system executes automatic actions (such as valve resets) in response to anomaly alerts, examine whether subsequent sessions and presence periods show fewer alerts, more stable flow, and more consistent temperatures compared to pre-intervention patterns.",2,"Validates interventions via aggregate session behavior; limited personal sensitivity."
Multi-dimensional clustering of anomalies for targeted mitigation strategies,"Cluster anomaly events using features derived from all five fields—flow shape and magnitude, session presence/absence, temperature level and variability, proximity patterns, and time-of-day; each cluster (e.g., ‘night-time hot leaks,’ ‘crowded high-flow shocks’) supports a different mitigation strategy.",4,"Combines all signals to cluster anomalies, revealing routines and occupancy patterns."
