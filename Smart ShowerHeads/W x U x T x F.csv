inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as in-session hot-water overuse vs off-session leaks,"Align each flow anomaly alert with usage log sessions, flow rate patterns, and temperature trends; alerts that occur during long, high-flow, high-temperature sessions indicate user-driven overuse, while alerts outside any session with sustained warm flow point to leaks when the system should be idle.",3,"Separates in-session overuse from off-session warm leaks, revealing when users are active versus idle windows."
"Leak likelihood scoring with flow, temperature, and session gaps","For every anomaly alert, check whether a usage session is active, whether flow history shows abnormal volume, and whether temperature is significantly above cold baseline; anomalies with high flow, elevated temperature, and no overlapping session are scored as highly likely leaks.",3,"Elevated warm flow without sessions signals leaks during idle periods, implying occupancy gaps."
Detection of hot-water leaks during unoccupied hours,"Use usage logs to find hours with no scheduled use, then flag anomaly alerts where flow history shows sustained low-to-moderate flow and temperature trends are warm; these events reveal hidden hot-water leaks occurring when no legitimate session is running.",5,"Flags warm flow during no-use windows, strongly exposing absence/away periods."
Energy impact estimation of anomaly events per day,"For each anomaly alert, integrate the abnormal portion of the flow rate history and combine it with the temperature above cold baseline, then aggregate by day; this quantifies how much extra thermal energy is wasted by abnormal usage beyond what is recorded as normal sessions.",2,"Aggregates daily energy waste from anomalies; operational with minimal personal detail."
Distinguishing scalding-risk anomalies from benign volume spikes,"Use anomaly alerts as markers, then inspect flow and temperature during each alert and see whether they overlap a usage session; high flow combined with temperatures above a scald threshold during active sessions indicates scalding-risk events, whereas cold or lukewarm spikes without users are benign volume anomalies.",3,"Identifies scald-risk events in active sessions, reflecting risky user conditions."
Heater capacity stress detection under abnormal demand,"When multiple usage sessions overlap in the logs and total flow rises sharply, check if anomaly alerts fire and temperature trends dip below normal setpoints; this pattern shows the heater being stressed beyond capacity during abnormal demand peaks.",2,"Assesses system stress under overlapping sessions; mostly operational load insights."
Progressive heater degradation revealed by anomaly–temperature patterns,"Compare historical anomaly alerts across months for similar session types and flow levels; if later anomalies show larger drops in temperature during normal or only slightly abnormal flow, it indicates progressive heater degradation.",2,"Tracks heater health over time with anomalies; equipment-focused, low personal exposure."
Detection of user-end thermal shocks caused by upstream anomalies,"If an anomaly alert marks a sudden system change, inspect concurrent temperature trends within active usage sessions; steep temperature shifts during those alerts, combined with unchanged individual fixture flow histories, indicate upstream anomalies causing thermal shock to users.",3,"Links upstream events to thermal shocks during sessions, indicating when users were impacted."
Short-session anomaly detection indicating extreme behaviors,Identify anomaly alerts that lie within very short usage sessions where flow rapidly spikes and temperature hits or approaches extreme values; these events suggest extreme user behaviors (quick blast of very hot or cold water) rather than infrastructure failures.,4,"Flags very short sessions with extreme temps/flow, highlighting unusual user behavior."
Cold-line anomaly vs heater fault discrimination,"For anomaly alerts, if flow rate is abnormal but temperature remains low or falls below normal across multiple sessions, the issue is more likely a cold-line fault or supply issue; if normal or high temperatures fail to be reached despite abnormal flow, heater or mixing faults are more probable.",2,"Differentiates cold-line vs heater faults using temps; technical focus with limited behavioral data."
Seasonal anomaly pattern characterization with hydraulic and thermal context,"Group anomaly alerts by season, then compare flow patterns, session overlays, and temperature deviations; more hot-side anomalies at high flow in winter vs lukewarm anomalies in summer reveal how seasonal demand interacts with the plumbing to create abnormal events.",2,"Seasonal patterning of anomalies; aggregate trends with minimal individual profiling."
Detection of forgotten showers from anomaly tails,"Find long usage sessions where anomaly alerts occur in the latter part of the session, with flow history showing steady high flow and temperature near comfort range but no additional user-adjustment signatures; this indicates showers left running longer than necessary rather than deliberate continuous use.",4,"Identifies long sessions with steady comfort temps and anomaly tails, revealing forgetfulness."
Anomaly contribution to per-session energy footprint,"For each session that overlaps an anomaly alert, integrate flow and temperature just during the alert and compare to the rest of the session; this reveals what fraction of each session’s energy use is due to abnormal behavior versus normal comfort use.",3,"Quantifies abnormal energy share per session, tying extra use to specific user activity."
Detection of low-volume but high-temperature seepage,"Anomaly alerts with small but persistent flow deviations in the history and consistently high temperature indicate low-volume seepage of hot water, which may not significantly alter session-level usage logs but still wastes energy over time.",3,"Finds warm seepage outside clear sessions, hinting at hidden use or idle losses."
Leak vs heavy-use anomaly discrimination via session structure,"Compare anomalies that occur within structured sessions (e.g., standard morning showers of similar length and temperature) versus anomalies that occur outside such patterns; structured-session anomalies suggest unusual behavior within normal routines, while structureless anomalies with flow and temperature indicate leaks.",3,"Distinguishes routine-based anomalies from off-pattern leaks, revealing adherence to typical schedules."
Verification of anomaly thresholds using normal session envelopes,"Build normal envelopes of flow and temperature trajectories for typical session types from the logs; anomaly alerts that fall completely within these envelopes indicate thresholds are too tight, while clear deviations without alerts reveal thresholds that are too loose.",2,"Tunes thresholds against normal session envelopes; model calibration with low personal exposure."
Detection of hot recirculation misbehavior via idle anomalies,"If anomaly alerts occur during periods with no active usage sessions, and flow history shows low but continuous flow at elevated temperatures, this points to misconfigured or malfunctioning recirculation systems constantly moving hot water.",2,"Identifies idle warm recirculation flow; operational misconfiguration, minimal behavioral insight."
Identifying fixtures prone to abnormal high-flow hot events,"Aggregate anomaly alerts by fixture and combine them with local flow histories, session counts, and temperature deviations; fixtures with frequent high-flow, high-temperature anomalies relative to their usage volume are hotspots for abnormal hot-water events.",3,"Ranks fixtures with frequent hot anomalies relative to use, mildly revealing location-specific behavior."
Cooldown behavior after hot anomalies at the fixture level,"When a hot-side anomaly alert ends, examine how quickly fixture-level temperature returns toward baseline while flow returns to normal; slow cooldown under low flow may indicate poorly insulated piping, while rapid cooldown under constant flow indicates aggressive mixing or cold replenishment.",2,"Assesses cooldown rates after hot anomalies; technical with little personal detail."
Self-resolving anomaly classification from flow and temperature recovery,"For anomaly alerts, track whether flow and temperature automatically return to patterns matching pre-anomaly sessions without user intervention; if so, classify these as self-resolving anomalies, distinct from persistent ones that distort subsequent session behavior.",2,"Labels anomalies as self-resolving based on recovery; system-focused, minimal behavioral exposure."
Detection of water hammer or pressure shocks with thermal tagging,Very short anomaly alerts where flow rate spikes sharply and temperature shifts briefly during active sessions indicate pressure shocks; comparing the temperature during those spikes reveals whether hot or cold lines are driving the hammer events.,2,"Detects brief spikes/temperature shifts for hammer events; technical pattern with limited user info."
Mapping anomalies to specific daily routines,"Cross-reference anomaly alerts with usage logs to see which recurring routines (e.g., 7 AM showers) they overlap, and pair this with flow and temperature signatures; if certain routines consistently hit abnormal patterns, they may be poorly matched to system capacity.",4,"Links anomalies to recurring routines and times, exposing daily schedule habits."
Anomaly-driven comfort disruption scoring per routine,"For each recurring session pattern, examine how often anomaly alerts occur while flow and temperature are in the user’s comfort band; when anomalies force temperature outside that band, the portion of session time affected contributes to a comfort disruption score.",4,"Scores comfort disruption within routines, revealing user comfort preferences and timing."
Detection of mixed hot–cold faults during anomaly events,Anomalies where temperature oscillates between near-cold and near-hot under abnormal flow while sessions are ongoing indicate mixing or cross-connection faults that become visible only under these abnormal hydraulic conditions.,3,"Identifies mixing faults during sessions, noting user exposure to temperature swings."
Recovery time comparison across fixtures after severe anomalies,"After severe anomaly alerts, compare how quickly each fixture’s flow and temperature patterns return to their usual envelopes during subsequent sessions; fixtures that recover slowly show greater vulnerability to persistent effects of abnormal events.",2,"Compares fixture recovery after anomalies; operational, low personal detail."
Long-term trend of anomaly-driven water loss normalized by usage,Sum abnormal flow derived from anomaly alerts over weeks or months and normalize by total session-based water use; a rising ratio indicates that a growing share of water is lost to anomalies rather than serving legitimate usage.,2,"Aggregates water loss from anomalies over time vs usage; minimal individual profiling."
Long-term trend of anomaly-driven energy loss normalized by hot demand,"Similarly, integrate the thermal energy associated with hot-side anomalies and normalize by total hot-water energy used in normal sessions; a rising fraction reveals increasing energy loss attributable to abnormal operation.",2,"Aggregated energy-loss trend from anomalies; system-level with little personal info."
Early-warning indicator based on mild anomalies within normal sessions,"Track small anomaly alerts with slight flow and temperature deviations inside normal sessions; an increasing count of such mild anomalies often precedes more severe problems, serving as an early-warning indicator for maintenance.",2,"Counts mild in-session anomalies as early warnings; aggregate signal with limited behavioral exposure."
"Classification of anomalies into leak, burst, heater, and control categories","Cluster anomaly alerts using flow history shape (steady vs spiky), session overlap, and temperature behavior (cold, warm, overshoot); steady off-session warm flow is leak-like, sudden spikes with high usage are burst-like, persistent low session temperatures suggest heater issues, and overshoot/oscillation points to control faults.",3,"Categorizes anomalies using session and temperature context, distinguishing user-driven events from system faults."
Validation of repair effectiveness via anomaly signature changes,"Before and after maintenance, compare the number, flow shapes, and temperature patterns of anomaly alerts and the session contexts where they occur; a shift from frequent high-volume hot anomalies to rare mild ones confirms that repairs addressed the core issues.",2,"Compares anomaly patterns pre/post repair; maintenance validation with minimal personal detail."
Context-aware anomaly escalation based on affected usage type,"For anomalies that occur during sessions classified as high-priority (e.g., long evening showers, elder-care routines) and that show large flow and temperature deviations, escalate alerts more aggressively than anomalies in low-priority, short, or unoccupied periods.",4,"Escalates based on session types (e.g., long showers, care routines), revealing user habits and priorities."
Predictive modeling of high-risk future sessions from early signals,"Analyze how early flow and temperature patterns in a session, along with historical anomaly overlaps for similar sessions, correlate with later anomaly alerts; use this to flag in-progress sessions that are likely to become abnormal and enable pre-emptive measures.",4,"Predicts which ongoing sessions may go abnormal from early flow/temperature, inferring near-term user behavior."
