inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as in-session with presence vs out-of-session without presence,"Align each flow anomaly alert with usage log sessions and proximity activity; anomalies that overlap a logged session and active proximity indicate user-driven extreme usage, while anomalies outside any session with no proximity suggest leaks or unlogged system behavior.",4,"Exposes occupancy context and distinguishes user-driven vs unattended anomalies."
Leak likelihood scoring using session gaps and absence of presence,"For every anomaly alert, check whether a usage session is active and whether proximity shows anyone near the fixture; alerts occurring outside sessions with no proximity receive a higher leak-likelihood score than alerts during sessions with confirmed presence.",4,"Absence-based leak scoring reveals empty-window events."
Detection of water left running after the user leaves,"Identify anomaly alerts where the usage log session continues and flow is abnormally high even though proximity data shows the user has left the area, revealing fixtures left running or stuck valves after the user departs.",4,"Shows departure timing with unattended flow."
Detection of unlogged or mis-logged abnormal sessions,"When anomaly alerts coincide with sustained proximity activity but no corresponding usage session is recorded, the combination suggests that abnormal water use is occurring without being properly logged as a session.",3,"Infers unlogged use tied to presence."
Crowd-driven anomaly detection in shared facilities,"Anomaly alerts that overlap periods with many rapid, overlapping proximity activations and multiple short usage sessions indicate crowd-driven abnormal usage patterns in public or shared restrooms.",4,"Reveals co-occupancy and congestion periods."
Single-user misuse versus mechanical failure discrimination,"If anomaly alerts align with long, continuous proximity from a single user and a single extended usage session, the event is more likely due to misuse (e.g., deliberately running water) than a mechanical failure that would typically persist without presence.",4,"Links anomalies to a single user’s behavior."
Estimating user disruption from anomalies,"Calculate, for each anomaly alert, how much of its duration overlaps both an active usage session and proximity presence; a larger overlap fraction indicates greater direct disruption to users compared to anomalies that occur when no one is present.",3,"Measures how much anomalies affect present users."
Idle-period anomaly criticality assessment,"Use usage logs to identify time windows with historically low or no sessions; anomaly alerts that occur in these idle windows and show no proximity activity are flagged as critical, as they are unlikely to be user-driven and more likely to represent hidden failures.",3,"Highlights anomalies during absence windows."
Sensor coverage and alignment validation from anomaly windows,"Repeated anomaly alerts with abnormal usage in the logs but little or no proximity activity indicate that the proximity sensor does not adequately cover where the user stands during abnormal flow, pointing to misalignment or blind spots.",2,"Focuses on sensor coverage with limited personal exposure."
Detection of sensor crosstalk in multi-fixture environments,"When anomaly alerts for one fixture coincide with usage sessions at that fixture but proximity activations mainly appear at a different nearby sensor, this suggests crosstalk where users at one fixture trigger another fixture’s proximity sensor.",2,"Identifies sensor crosstalk; low identifiability."
Queue and congestion-related anomaly identification,"Combine anomaly alert times with clusters of proximity activations and overlapping usage sessions to detect anomalies that happen when many people are waiting and moving around fixtures, which may stress plumbing or encourage misuse.",3,"Shows crowding periods and movement around fixtures."
Auto-shutoff effectiveness measurement during anomalies,"For anomalies that should trigger automatic shutoff, examine whether abnormal flow (implied by the alert), the usage session in the logs, and proximity activity all end soon after the alert; if sessions and presence persist, auto-shutoff may be ineffective or ignored.",3,"Assesses response timing during user presence."
Detection of repeated approach–abort behavior around anomalies,"Look for patterns where proximity activations show users approaching, an anomaly alert triggers during a short usage session, and users quickly leave; repeated cycles indicate a fixture that behaves abnormally early in use, causing users to abort.",3,"Captures hesitant/aborted attempts linked to anomalies."
Segregation of occupancy-related anomalies from infrastructure-related anomalies,Compare anomaly frequency during high-occupancy periods (many sessions and strong proximity activity) versus low-occupancy periods; anomalies that persist in low-occupancy windows point more strongly to infrastructure problems than those that only occur under heavy occupancy.,3,"Splits anomalies by occupancy level."
Normalization of anomaly rates by actual presence time,Compute anomaly counts per fixture and normalize by total proximity-based presence time and total logged session time; a high ratio of anomalies per hour of presence indicates fixtures that behave abnormally relative to how often they are actually used.,2,"Aggregated rate metric with limited personal detail."
Detection of unattended abnormal operation in off-hours,Align anomaly alerts with usage logs that show no sessions and proximity data that shows no people around during off-hours; anomalies in these windows reveal unattended abnormal flows that would otherwise remain unnoticed.,4,"Exposes off-hours unattended anomalies and absence patterns."
Detection of deliberate policy circumvention behaviors,"If policies specify that water should only flow when presence is detected, anomaly alerts with active usage sessions but little or no proximity activity indicate that users may be circumventing presence requirements (e.g., by overriding sensors).",4,"Reveals policy circumvention tied to users."
Prioritization of anomalies affecting many distinct presence episodes,"Count how many separate proximity episodes and usage sessions overlap each anomaly alert; anomalies that repeatedly disrupt many different sessions and presence episodes should be prioritized higher than those experienced by only a single, rare user.",3,"Ranks anomalies by number of impacted presences."
Self-resolving anomaly pattern detection without user intervention,"Identify anomaly alerts where abnormal patterns end without any new proximity activity or the start/end of a usage session, suggesting self-resolving pressure or valve fluctuations that clear spontaneously without user interaction.",2,"Self-resolving behavior with little personal data."
Differentiation of abnormal cleaning cycles from leaks,"Anomalies overlapping clusters of short usage sessions and intermittent proximity activity in cleaning time windows are likely abnormal cleaning cycles, while anomalies with no sessions and no presence indicate genuine leaks or remote actuation issues.",3,"Infers cleaning vs leak based on activity patterns."
Dynamic adjustment of anomaly thresholds using presence-context,"Use historical correlations between presence, session patterns, and anomaly alerts to tune thresholds: allow slightly higher flow-related variability during high-occupancy periods with many sessions, and tighten thresholds during expected no-presence windows.",2,"Threshold tuning with occupancy context; low identity risk."
Security anomaly detection combining off-hours presence and alerts,"Anomaly alerts that occur together with unexpected proximity activity during off-hours, even if usage logs show only short or partial sessions, may indicate tampering or unauthorized use of fixtures in restricted times.",4,"Flags off-hours presence, high security/privacy impact."
Detection of valves reopening after users leave,"Find anomaly events where abnormal flow and alerts cease while proximity is active and a session appears to end, but then resume after proximity and session logging stop, indicating valves that spontaneously reopen in the absence of users.",4,"Reveals unintended flow restarting after departure."
Anomaly clustering by presence and session signature,"Cluster anomaly alerts according to whether they occur with no session and no presence, with sessions but no presence, or with sessions and strong presence; each cluster points to different root-cause categories such as leaks, logging faults, or misuse.",3,"Categorizes anomalies using occupancy context."
Testing effectiveness of user-facing anomaly notifications,"When anomaly alerts generate user-visible messages or sounds, examine whether proximity activity increases near the fixture and whether the usage session ends shortly afterward; a weak correlation suggests that alerts are not prompting users to respond.",3,"Measures responsiveness to alerts with timing."
Early identification of fixtures prone to user-present anomalies,Analyze how often anomaly alerts at a fixture coincide with active presence and ongoing sessions; fixtures with disproportionately high rates of user-present anomalies may have ergonomics or control issues that cause abnormal behavior during normal use.,3,"Profiles fixtures with user-present anomaly patterns."
Predictive modeling of high-risk sessions based on early presence and usage signals,"Use early patterns in proximity activations and the initial phase of the usage session (e.g., rapid re-triggers, unusual session start times) to predict which sessions are likely to generate anomaly alerts later, enabling proactive monitoring or warnings.",4,"Predicts risky sessions from early behavioral cues."
Validation of occupancy models using anomaly and session data,Compare building-level occupancy expectations with actual proximity and usage logs during anomaly alerts; anomalies with no presence or sessions during assumed ‘occupied’ windows indicate mismatches between occupancy models and real fixture usage.,3,"Exposes mismatches between expected and real occupancy."
Quantifying unobserved risk from anomalies when users are absent,Aggregate anomaly alerts that occur without overlapping sessions or proximity; their durations and recurrence provide a measure of how often risky abnormal flows occur without anyone nearby to notice them.,3,"Absence-based risk quantification for unattended events."
Context-aware escalation of anomalies based on affected session type,"Cross-reference anomalies with the characteristics of overlapping sessions (e.g., short vs long, frequent vs rare) and presence behavior; anomalies disrupting critical or vulnerable session types (such as those inferred to involve children or elderly users) are escalated more aggressively.",4,"Escalation based on session type, potentially inferring vulnerable users."
