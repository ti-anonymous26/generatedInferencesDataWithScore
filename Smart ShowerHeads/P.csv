Inference,Description,score,short rationale
High activation frequency indicates intensive interaction at that fixture,"Frequent proximity-based on/off events over a day suggest that this faucet or showerhead is used heavily, reflecting a high number of user interactions in that location.",3,"Heavy usage patterns expose occupant presence and frequency."
Sparse activation patterns imply low utilization or secondary role,Very few proximity activations over long periods indicate that the fixture is rarely approached or that it plays a minor role in daily routines.,2,"Minimal presence signal with limited behavioral detail."
Consistent morning peaks reveal stable hygiene routines,"Clustering of proximity activations in early morning windows across many days indicates stable habits such as regular washing, brushing, or showering routines.",4,"Reveals stable daily hygiene schedule and timing."
Evening or late-night peaks point to end-of-day usage rituals,"When activations repeatedly cluster at night, it suggests routines like pre-sleep washing or late showers that are consistently initiated via proximity sensing.",4,"Shows end-of-day routines and sleep timing cues."
Activations during typical absence windows hint at unusual activity,"Proximity activations appearing during historically low-usage periods signal unexpected presence, schedule changes, or accidental sensor triggering.",4,"Highlights unexpected occupancy windows."
Weekend-dominant activation patterns indicate schedule-driven usage,Higher activation counts on weekends compared to weekdays imply that users interact more with the fixture when they are off work or spending more time at home.,3,"Shows work/leisure schedule tendencies."
Day-of-week variation exposes different routine structures,"Distinct patterns (e.g., Monday and Friday peaks vs midweek lows) reflect weekly rhythms such as specific days with more intensive cleaning or showering.",3,"Maps weekly routine differences by day."
Short-duration activations suggest quick tasks or possible false triggers,On–off pairs with very brief intervals indicate quick interactions like hand rinses or non-purposeful triggers caused by passing movement near the sensor.,2,"Indicates quick tasks or noise with low identifiability."
Long-duration activations reveal extended use sessions,On–off intervals that stay open much longer than the typical median duration imply extended tasks such as longer showers or prolonged washing at that fixture.,3,"Signals long personal tasks at a location."
Burst-like activation sequences indicate clustered user presence,"Many activations in a short time window suggest a user staying near the fixture, performing repeated or multi-step tasks.",3,"Shows clustered presence and task intensity."
Increase in average activation duration signals changing habits,"A trend where on–off intervals grow longer over time suggests users are spending more time per interaction, possibly shifting to more elaborate use.",3,"Tracks habit shift toward longer sessions."
Decrease in activation duration implies more efficient or hurried use,"If average activation times shrink, it suggests users are performing shorter interactions, becoming more efficient or changing routines.",2,"Suggests efficiency changes with little identity risk."
Growing activation count over time indicates rising fixture importance,A steady rise in daily or weekly proximity activations suggests this fixture is becoming more central to occupants’ routines or overall traffic has increased.,3,"Shows rising fixture centrality reflecting behavioral change."
Drop in activation count flags possible disuse or alternative behaviors,"A noticeable decline in proximity activations after a stable period indicates that users may be avoiding that fixture, using another one, or occupying the space less.",3,"Indicates avoidance or absence trends over time."
Sudden activation spikes mark special events or occupancy surges,A one-off day with a very high number of proximity activations compared to baseline suggests temporary conditions such as guests or atypical intensive use.,3,"Highlights unusual occupancy or guest events."
Extended periods with zero activations indicate vacancy or sensor failure,Long continuous gaps with no proximity-based on/off events may denote prolonged absence or potential malfunction of the proximity sensor or logging system.,4,"Reveals prolonged absence periods or unattended space."
Irregular on/off pairing points to logging or control anomalies,"Missing or mismatched on/off events suggest anomalies in event logging, communication glitches, or control logic issues at the sensor.",1,"Primarily system issues with minimal personal data."
Time-of-day shift in activation peaks reveals changing daily schedules,"If the primary activation peak gradually moves from one time window to another, it indicates a shift in occupants’ routine timing.",4,"Shows when routines move, exposing schedule adjustments."
Multimodal daily patterns indicate diverse usage scenarios,Days showing two or more distinct activation peaks suggest that the same fixture supports multiple routine types in different parts of the day.,3,"Multiple peaks outline different routine types."
High activation frequency with very short durations suggests sensor sensitivity issues,"When there are many extremely brief activations, it may indicate that the proximity sensor is overly sensitive or frequently triggered by pass-by motion.",1,"Likely sensor noise with limited behavioral insight."
"Stable activation rhythm indicates mature, predictable behavior","When daily activation counts and timing remain highly consistent over long periods, it suggests well-established routines with little change in usage.",4,"Predictable timing makes occupants’ schedule highly inferable."
Growing variability in activation times signals lifestyle or schedule changes,"If the distribution of activation times becomes more scattered across the day, it implies less structured routines or irregular occupancy.",3,"Shows lifestyle volatility without precise identity."
Fixture-level comparison of activation density reveals primary vs secondary points of use,Comparing total proximity activations across fixtures shows which ones function as primary interaction points versus secondary or backup ones.,2,"Identifies preferred fixtures but coarse on timing."
Activation clusters overlapping among multiple fixtures imply concurrent usage zones,"If several fixtures show overlapping activation bursts in the same time window, it suggests multiple occupants using different faucets or showerheads simultaneously.",4,"Exposes co-occupancy windows and spatial coordination."
Shift from clustered to isolated activations indicates reduced multi-step tasks,"Transition from many back-to-back activations toward more isolated single activations suggests a change from complex tasks to simpler, one-off interactions.",2,"Shows task complexity shift with limited personal detail."
Consistent activation just after specific clock times indicates habit-driven starts,Repeated activations at nearly the same time highlight habitually timed actions such as a user’s precise routine start.,5,"Precise clock-linked behavior strongly identifies individual routines."
Night-time activation emergence after prior absence hints at new occupancy pattern,"If night-time activations start appearing in a fixture that previously had none, it suggests new behavior such as shift work, changed sleep patterns, or additional usage.",4,"Reveals new night presence patterns affecting security and privacy."
Seasonal shifts in activation timing reflect daylight or routine changes,"Over months, if peak activation windows drift relative to clock time, that pattern aligns with seasonal adjustments in daily routines.",2,"Coarse seasonal shifts with limited identifiability."
High activation counts with moderate durations suggest many short but purposeful tasks,"When activation numbers are high but average duration stays moderate, it reflects many distinct but meaningful interactions like repeated handwashing.",2,"Indicates frequent tasks without fine-grained schedule exposure."
Low activation count with very long durations indicates infrequent but intensive use,"A pattern of few daily activations, each lasting much longer than typical, suggests the fixture is used rarely but for substantial continuous tasks.",3,"Reveals occasional long sessions with modest schedule detail."
