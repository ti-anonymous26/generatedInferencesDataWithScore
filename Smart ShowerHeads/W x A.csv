inference,Description,score,short rationale
Leak versus heavy-use anomaly classification,"Analyze the detailed flow rate pattern during each flow anomaly alert window; long, flat, low-to-medium flow suggests a leak, while high, structured flow with clear ramp-up and ramp-down indicates legitimate heavy water use such as cleaning or extended showering.",2,"Separates occupant-driven heavy use from leaks, modest behavioral signal."
Anomaly severity by abnormal volume,"Integrate the water flow rate history over the exact interval marked by each flow anomaly alert to compute the total abnormal water volume associated with that event, allowing ranking of anomalies by actual water loss or impact.",1,"Quantifies water loss only, little behavioral detail."
Burst pipe versus partially open fixture,"Use the gradient and magnitude of the flow rate history around anomaly alerts; very rapid jumps to very high flow suggest a pipe burst, while moderate increases that stabilize at a lower level indicate a partially open faucet or valve.",1,"Plumbing failure classification with no routine insight."
Detection of persistent micro-leaks below alert threshold,Inspect flow rate segments just below the anomaly threshold that occur frequently and for long durations; repeated near-threshold flow combined with occasional anomaly alerts reveals persistent micro-leaks that do not always trigger alerts on their own.,1,"Leak detection without linking to occupant habits."
False-positive anomaly identification,"Compare flow rate patterns tagged as anomalous with historical, previously accepted flow signatures; if repeated alerts coincide with flow shapes that match normal patterns, they can be classified as false positives and used to refine alert rules.",1,"Model quality check with minimal personal exposure."
Dynamic baseline adjustment for anomaly detection,"Use long-term flow rate history to compute time-of-day and day-of-week baselines, then analyze how often anomaly alerts occur against those baselines to auto-adjust thresholds so that alerts fire only when flow significantly exceeds context-aware expectations.",1,"Baseline tuning; does not directly reveal individuals."
Anomaly onset and offset refinement,"Refine the start and end timestamps of each flow anomaly alert by scanning the high-resolution flow rate history to find the precise moment when flow departed from and returned to normal levels, improving localization of the root cause.",2,"Pinpoints event timing, lightly exposing routine windows."
Multi-stage anomaly episode grouping,"Group consecutive flow anomaly alerts that occur over a continuous abnormal flow rate segment into a single multi-stage anomaly episode, differentiating between one long underlying problem and many small, independent issues.",1,"Aggregates events with negligible personal context."
Anomaly recovery verification,"After an anomaly alert and subsequent maintenance action, verify that the flow rate history returns to its previous baseline range and remains stable, confirming that the issue has been resolved instead of recurring in a hidden form.",1,"Checks stabilization; no behavioral detail."
Sensor or meter malfunction detection,"Identify anomaly alerts where the flow rate history shows impossible or highly erratic patterns (e.g., rapid spikes from zero to maximum and back within milliseconds) that do not match physical reality, suggesting faulty sensors or meters rather than true plumbing problems.",1,"Targets device faults, not occupant behavior."
Hotspot analysis of chronic anomaly zones,"Aggregate anomaly alerts and sum their associated abnormal volumes from the flow rate history per fixture or zone to identify hotspots where chronic high-impact anomalies occur most frequently, focusing maintenance resources where they are most needed.",2,"Reveals fixtures with repeated issues, modest location preference signal."
Nighttime anomaly risk characterization,Compute typical overnight flow baselines from the flow rate history and examine anomaly alerts that occur during these low-use periods; alerts at times when normal flow is near zero are far more likely to represent leaks or failures than legitimate use.,4,"Exposes night-time presence/absence patterns useful for profiling."
Water-hammer and pressure shock detection,"Within anomaly alert windows, analyze very short, high-magnitude spikes in the flow rate history along with rapid fluctuations; such patterns reveal water-hammer or pressure shock events that may damage plumbing even if total volume is low.",1,"Mechanical effect detection with no personal inference."
Progressive deterioration before major failure,"Track sequences of smaller anomaly alerts whose associated flow rate patterns show gradually increasing abnormal flow over time; this trend indicates progressive deterioration, such as a valve or pipe joint slowly failing before a major break.",1,"Focuses on plumbing deterioration, not user behavior."
Cost estimation for each anomaly event,"Translate the abnormal water volume derived from the flow rate history for each anomaly alert into a monetary cost using local water tariffs, enabling financial impact estimation per anomaly and prioritization of high-cost issues.",1,"Costing of events without behavioral specificity."
Anomaly type taxonomy from flow signatures,"Cluster anomaly alerts based on the shape of the flow rate history during each alert (e.g., sudden spikes, sustained plateaus, oscillations), creating a taxonomy of anomaly types that can be labeled as leaks, bursts, stuck valves, or sensor errors.",1,"Categorization of anomalies with no routine exposure."
Evaluation of anomaly detection model precision,"Compare anomaly alert labels with post-hoc classification of abnormal flow segments from the flow rate history to estimate how many flow anomalies were correctly flagged versus normal patterns incorrectly labeled, allowing precision/false-positive analysis.",1,"Model performance review; negligible personal data."
Evaluation of anomaly detection model recall,"Scan the flow rate history for unflagged periods that exhibit abnormal patterns similar to known anomalies; if these are not associated with anomaly alerts, they represent missed detections and can be used to improve the detection model’s recall.",1,"Missed anomaly analysis without personal context."
Event-driven auto-shutoff policy tuning,"Use abnormal flow magnitude and duration in each anomaly alert’s flow rate segment to determine which types of anomalies should trigger automatic shutoff versus user-only notifications, balancing safety with user experience.",2,"Ties severity to control actions, minor link to user impact."
Seasonal impact on anomaly frequency,Analyze how often flow anomaly alerts occur in different seasons in conjunction with seasonal changes in baseline flow patterns; higher frequencies during freezing or very hot periods may suggest seasonal stress on plumbing that requires anticipatory mitigation.,1,"Seasonal patterns are coarse with little identifiability."
Post-anomaly baseline shift detection,Compare the average flow rate patterns before and after major anomaly alerts; a higher baseline after a severe anomaly may indicate that residual leaks or configuration changes are causing more continuous water use than before.,2,"Sustained baseline changes hint at ongoing use or leaks, limited routine detail."
Distinguishing intermittent leaks from user-driven variability,"In anomaly windows where flow ramps up and down in irregular but moderate patterns, examine surrounding flow history; if similar shapes occur without user presence or scheduling, the pattern can be labeled as intermittent leaks rather than normal variability.",3,"Differentiates presence-driven use from leaks, exposing occupancy signals."
Infrastructure capacity stress identification,"Flow anomaly alerts occurring when flow rate history shows total system flow near the maximum rated capacity of pipes or heaters indicate capacity stress, suggesting that the infrastructure is undersized for peak conditions.",2,"High-flow peaks suggest simultaneous use but lack individual identity."
Priority ranking of maintenance work orders,"Combine the frequency of anomaly alerts with the abnormal volumes from the flow rate history to compute a risk or impact score per fixture or zone, aiding in prioritizing which issues to address first in maintenance planning.",2,"Highlights zones with repeated impact, modestly revealing usage concentration."
Real-time anomaly escalation decision rules,"Use early trends in the flow rate history immediately after an anomaly alert (e.g., whether flow is increasing, stable, or decreasing) to decide whether to escalate quickly to emergency shutoff or wait for user intervention.",2,"Leverages live usage trends, slight timing exposure."
Cross-validation between anomaly thresholds and real usage peaks,Check how often genuine high-flow events in the flow rate history fail to generate alerts or generate only low-priority alerts; mismatch between thresholds and real-world peaks prompts adjustment of anomaly thresholds to better match physical behavior.,2,"Shows timing and magnitude of legitimate high-use periods."
Detection of slow-drip anomalies masked in daily totals,"Use anomaly alerts combined with detailed low-level flow rate segments to uncover very small but continuous flows, which contribute marginally to daily totals but represent long-term waste if left unresolved.",1,"Targets tiny leaks with minimal personal information."
Learning-based anomaly pattern prediction,"Train models on sequences of normal flow rate history leading up to previous anomaly alerts to identify predictive precursors; when similar precursors appear without an alert yet, the system can pre-emptively flag heightened risk for imminent anomalies.",3,"Uses normal-use precursors, revealing routine patterns that precede issues."
Verification of anomaly suppression rules,"When certain anomaly types are intentionally suppressed (e.g., low-priority events), periodically check the flow rate segments that would have been flagged to ensure that suppression is not hiding significant abnormal flows.",1,"Governance of alerts with negligible behavior exposure."
