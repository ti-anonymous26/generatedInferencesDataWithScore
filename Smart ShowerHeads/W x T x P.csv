inference,Description,score,short rationale
True comfort envelope during active presence,"Filter temperature trends and flow rate history to only those periods where proximity sensors detect a user nearby, then derive the typical combinations of temperature and flow that users actually experience while present (ignoring idle or background heating).",4,"Profiles actual comfort choices while users are present."
Pre-heating wait time and wasted volume,"For each approach event detected by proximity, measure how long the user remains present while flow is running and temperature is still below their usual comfort range, integrating the corresponding flow to estimate how much water is wasted while they wait for it to warm up.",3,"Reveals wait behavior and waste during approach."
Scalding-risk detection under real user exposure,"Identify intervals when proximity shows the user is in front of the fixture, flow rate is high enough to contact skin, and temperature exceeds a safety threshold, flagging only those hot spikes that occur while a user is actually present and exposed.",4,"Directly ties scalding spikes to present users."
Cold-shock detection during showers,"During continuous proximity and significant flow (indicating a shower), detect sudden drops in temperature relative to the recent average, marking true cold-shock events that users are likely to feel rather than brief temperature noise when nobody is nearby.",4,"Captures cold shocks experienced mid-shower."
Hot- versus cold-side leak classification with absence of presence,"When flow rate history shows sustained flow while proximity indicates no user is present, use the associated temperature level to determine whether the leak is on the hot side (elevated temperature) or cold side (near ambient), helping prioritize energy-wasting leaks.",3,"Classifies unattended leaks using temperature."
Energy waste from hot water running with no user present,Detect periods where temperature is significantly above cold baseline and flow rate is non-zero while proximity data shows no human presence; integrate flow during those intervals to estimate hot-water energy wasted when nobody is actually using the fixture.,3,"Quantifies hot-water waste during absence."
Approach–adjust–stabilize interaction pattern,"Use proximity to mark user approach, then observe how temperature and flow change right after arrival; sequences where users remain present while temperature and flow curve toward a stable point reveal how they adjust controls to reach a comfortable setting.",3,"Shows adjustment patterns on arrival."
User tolerance to temperature ramp speed,"For each approach event with continuous presence, measure the temperature ramp rate under the chosen flow and whether the user remains or leaves before reaching the usual comfort temperature, indicating how patient they are with slow-warming water at that flow level.",3,"Reveals patience with warm-up speed."
Presence-aware optimal preheat strategy,"Combine historical approach times (proximity), target comfort temperatures, and typical flow rates during early use to design preheat schedules that bring water close to the right temperature just before users arrive, reducing wait time without heating for long periods with no presence.",3,"Predictive preheat based on routine presence."
Detection of inefficient high-flow warm-up behavior,"Find cases where, during an approach with presence detected, users immediately open the fixture to high flow and maintain it while temperature is still far from the comfort range, indicating that warm-up is being done at unnecessarily high flow rates.",3,"Identifies wasteful high-flow warm-up habits."
Detection of efficient low-flow warm-up behavior,"Identify patterns where users, while present, run low flow until temperature nears the comfort range and only then increase flow, indicating a behavior that conserves both water and energy during the warm-up phase.",2,"Highlights efficient warm-up style; limited identity."
Thermal stability index under user presence,"During intervals of continuous presence and relatively steady flow, measure temperature variance; high variance in this presence-constrained window reveals poor thermal stability that users directly experience, unlike fluctuations when nobody is present.",3,"Measures comfort stability users feel."
Avoidance behavior in response to extreme temperatures,"Correlate sharp rises or drops in temperature with changes in proximity; if users tend to move away or break presence when temperature crosses certain thresholds while flow remains on, this shows active avoidance of uncomfortable or unsafe temperatures.",3,"Shows avoidance reactions and thresholds."
Detection of presence-only tasks near warm fixtures,"Look for intervals where proximity indicates a user is near the fixture, temperature is elevated (due to recent use), but flow remains near zero; this reveals non-water tasks like grooming or using residual warmth, separate from active water consumption.",3,"Reveals near-fixture behavior without flow."
Distinguishing showers from sink usage via joint signals,"Combine long continuous presence, sustained moderate-to-high flow, and stable warm temperatures to identify showers, while short, intermittent presence with lower flow and modest temperatures indicate sink usage, even without explicit fixture labels.",4,"Infers activity type (shower vs sink) with presence/flow/temp."
Detection of rinsing phases in user presence,"Within intervals of continuous proximity, identify sub-periods where flow increases and temperature slightly decreases relative to the previous warm phase, signaling rinse phases that differ from the hotter, possibly lower-flow washing phase.",3,"Identifies rinse phases inside sessions."
Flow-dependent comfort temperature preferences,"When users are present, compare chosen temperature levels at different average flow rates; some users may prefer slightly lower temperatures at high flow (strong spray) and higher temperatures at low flow (gentle stream) for the same perceived comfort.",3,"Profiles comfort preferences by flow level."
Thermal shock mitigation need in multi-user or shared spaces,"In shared environments, detect how often users experience rapid temperature changes while present and under steady flow (via temperature and flow), and whether proximity shows frequent turnover of users; high rates suggest the system needs better mixing or buffering.",3,"Highlights user-experienced shocks in shared spaces."
Heat-loss characterization after users leave,"After proximity drops to zero and flow stops, observe how fast temperature in the pipes decays back toward baseline; comparing this decay across fixtures reveals differences in insulation quality and heat retention experienced between user visits.",2,"Infrastructure insight post-use; low identity risk."
Presence-triggered maximum temperature enforcement,"Use proximity to detect when users are present, and adjust or cap the permissible temperature range dynamically during those intervals so that high-temperature water available in the system is not actually delivered while someone is in front of the fixture.",3,"Applies safety caps based on presence; moderate exposure."
Identification of children’s presence from height-based proximity and gentle temperature choices,"If proximity sensors provide height or zone information, correlate lower sensing zones with warm-but-not-hot temperature selections and modest flows while presence is maintained to infer child use, prompting stricter temperature and flow safety limits.",5,"Infers child presence and adjusts safety."
Detection of sensor misalignment via comfort episodes without presence,Periods where flow and temperature patterns clearly match typical comfort usage episodes but proximity never registers presence suggest that the proximity sensor is misaligned or blind to where users actually stand during use.,2,"Sensor alignment issue inferred; limited behavioral risk."
Detection of nuisance triggers without water or thermal change,"Frequent short proximity activations that are not followed by significant flow changes or temperature adjustments indicate nuisance triggers, such as people walking past, which do not correspond to real thermal or water-use events.",1,"Noise detection with negligible personal data."
"User-specific comfort signatures using presence, flow, and temperature","For each persistent presence pattern (e.g., particular times of day or durations), extract typical flow–temperature combinations when users are standing in front of the fixture to build user-specific comfort signatures without relying on explicit identity.",5,"Creates de facto user comfort fingerprints."
Quantifying user exposure to suboptimal temperatures,"Within intervals of continuous proximity and non-zero flow, compute how long users experience water outside their preferred comfort temperature band, estimating exposure to too-cold or too-hot water that might lead to discomfort or behavior change.",3,"Measures time users spend outside comfort range."
Behavioral adaptation to slow heaters,"For fixtures with consistently slow temperature ramp-up under typical flow, observe whether users increasingly shorten their presence or open flow earlier and leave while water warms; combined signals show adaptation strategies to slow heater performance.",3,"Shows behavioral adaptation to slow warm-up."
"Detection of ‘test, adjust, leave’ behavior","Short episodes where proximity is present, flow briefly increases, temperature is assessed (small change), and then presence and flow cease indicate users just testing or checking water conditions rather than performing a full wash or shower.",3,"Identifies quick test-and-leave interactions."
Estimation of comfort adaptation across seasons,"Over different seasons, compare, only during presence and non-zero flow, the chosen temperatures and flow levels; users may accept cooler temperatures at higher ambient temperatures, changing their comfort envelope without explicit feedback.",3,"Shows seasonal comfort adaptation."
"Presence-aware detection of high-flow, low-benefit usage","Find intervals where users are present and flow is high but the temperature is either still ramping or is far from their usual comfort range; such periods represent high water throughput with low comfort benefit, suggesting an opportunity for control or feedback.",3,"Highlights wasteful high-flow periods with little comfort."
Detection of pre-use flushing routines,"Use proximity to detect users standing near the fixture while they run moderate to high flow and then adjust temperature until it stabilizes, before transitioning into a steady comfort phase; these flush segments can be separated from actual bathing or washing.",3,"Identifies flushing phases before main use."
Dynamic recommendations for ideal startup settings,"By analyzing how users habitually adjust flow and temperature after they arrive (proximity) to reach comfort, the system can suggest or automatically set initial flow and temperature closer to their preferred values, reducing adjustment time while they are present.",3,"Predicts preferred startup settings based on habits."
Detection of presence near overheated but idle fixtures,"Identify intervals where temperature at the outlet is high due to prior use, no flow is currently running, and proximity indicates someone standing nearby; this may represent users gauging heat before turning water on, hinting at perceived scald risk even before flow starts.",3,"Shows users gauging heat near idle hot fixtures."
