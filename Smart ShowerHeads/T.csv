Consistently high setpoints indicate preference for hotter water,"If historical temperature settings cluster near the upper allowed range, it suggests users systematically prefer hotter water for their faucet or showerhead.",4,"Strongly profiles hot-water comfort preference."
Consistently low setpoints indicate comfort with cooler water,"When temperature settings remain near the lower range over time, it implies users are comfortable with cooler water, possibly due to climate, health, or habit.",3,"Reveals cooler preference potentially tied to health or habit."
Narrow temperature band reflects stable comfort preference,"Minimal variation around a small temperature window indicates a strong, stable comfort point that users rarely adjust.",4,"Shows precise comfort point usable for re-identification."
Wide temperature swings suggest diverse use cases or users,Frequent large shifts between low and high setpoints indicate multiple use cases or multiple users with different preferences.,3,"Hints at multiple users or tasks, moderate identifiability."
Increasing average setpoint over time indicates warming preference drift,"A gradual upward trend in historical temperature settings shows that the typical chosen temperature is rising, suggesting users are slowly preferring warmer water.",3,"Tracks evolving comfort drift over time."
Decreasing average setpoint over time indicates cooling preference drift,"A long-term downward trend in setpoints implies users are deliberately choosing cooler temperatures, potentially due to comfort change, safety concerns, or seasonal adaptation.",3,"Shows sustained cooling shift tied to behavior or safety."
Morning peaks in setpoint temperatures suggest hotter water for wake-up routines,"When higher temperature selections cluster in morning hours, it indicates users prefer hotter water during wake-up or early hygiene routines.",4,"Reveals morning routine timing and intensity."
Evening peaks in setpoint temperatures suggest hotter water for relaxation,Higher temperatures predominantly chosen in the evening suggest users associate hot water with relaxation or end-of-day routines.,4,"Shows evening routine patterns and comfort choices."
"Midday moderate setpoints imply quick, functional usage","If midday setpoints hover in a mid-range, distinct from morning/evening peaks, it suggests more functional, less comfort-focused use during those hours.",2,"Functional pattern with limited re-identification."
Weekend temperature patterns differing from weekdays reveal schedule-driven comfort,A distinct shift in typical setpoints on weekends indicates that temperature choices are influenced by non-workday routines.,3,"Shows weekday/weekend routine differences."
Seasonal increase in setpoints during colder months indicates climate-driven adjustment,Higher typical temperatures in colder seasons reflect users compensating for ambient temperature with hotter water.,3,"Seasonal adaptation with moderate identifiability."
Seasonal decrease in setpoints during hotter months indicates heat-avoidance behavior,Lower preferred setpoints during hot seasons suggest users intentionally choose cooler water to offset environmental heat.,3,"Seasonal cooling behavior with limited identity risk."
Frequent small adjustments around a target value indicate fine-tuning for comfort,Many minor up/down changes within a narrow band during a single session suggest users are actively tuning temperature to reach an exact comfort point.,3,"Shows active fine-tuning behavior within sessions."
Infrequent adjustments indicate set-and-forget behavior,"If temperature settings remain unchanged for long periods, it implies users rarely interact with temperature controls once a comfortable baseline is found.",2,"Low interaction pattern with limited personal detail."
Sudden large jumps in setpoint indicate discrete task-specific settings,Occasional large shifts suggest distinct operational modes such as hot cleaning versus cool rinsing rather than incremental comfort adjustments.,3,"Reveals task-driven changes, moderate profiling."
Frequent rapid changes during a single session indicate difficulty finding comfort,A pattern of many consecutive temperature changes within a short time implies the user struggles to reach a satisfactory temperature.,3,"Captures comfort struggle during a session."
User-specific temperature profiles emerge from recurring patterns,Repeated reuse of the same few temperature values over many days suggests identifiable preference profiles even without explicit user IDs.,5,"Strongly re-identifies users via preference signature."
Asymmetric adjustment behavior reveals directional bias,"If increases in setpoint are more common than decreases, or vice versa, it suggests users generally feel the default is too cold or too hot.",3,"Shows directional preference bias tied to routines."
Clustered use of a small set of preset values indicates reliance on defaults,"If most historical settings match a limited set of discrete temperatures, it implies users heavily rely on preset or recommended values.",2,"Preset reliance with low personal specificity."
Gradual stabilization after installation reflects learning and adaptation,"High variability in early temperature changes followed by a stable band suggests that users initially explored the range, then converged on preferred settings.",2,"Learning curve insight with modest identity exposure."
Persistent high maximum setpoints suggest latent scalding risk tolerance,"Regular use of very high temperatures indicates users accept or expect near-scalding temperatures, relevant for risk assessment.",4,"Shows tolerance for very hot water, notable personal trait."
Avoidance of extreme setpoints indicates conservative temperature behavior,"If temperature history never approaches the extremes, it suggests users intentionally stay within a comfortable and perceived safe mid-range.",2,"Conservative behavior with limited re-identification."
Distinct temperature distributions across fixtures indicate room-specific roles,"If one faucet consistently shows cooler setpoints and another hotter, it implies different functional roles purely from their temperature histories.",3,"Reveals location-specific roles and preferences."
Abrupt long-term shift in typical setpoints signals lifestyle or occupant change,"A sudden, sustained change in the baseline temperature level implies a major shift, such as a new occupant or changed routine.",4,"Indicates occupancy/lifestyle change."
High day-to-day variability in temperatures indicates irregular usage patterns,"When average daily setpoints fluctuate widely, it suggests inconsistent routines, varying tasks, or changing environmental conditions.",3,"Shows irregular routines across days."
Low day-to-day variability indicates highly routinized use,"Small differences in daily temperature statistics imply very stable, habitual use with little deviation from established comfort norms.",4,"Highly routinized behavior useful for profiling."
Correlated temperature changes at similar times each day reveal structured rituals,"Repeating patterns of setpoints at similar times each day show structured, time-anchored routines.",4,"Strongly exposes daily rituals and timing."
Short bursts of unusually low temperatures suggest intentional cold-water events,Occasional clearly lower-than-normal setpoints within an otherwise warm pattern indicate specific cold-water use cases.,3,"Identifies intentional cold-use episodes."
Short bursts of unusually high temperatures suggest intensive thermal tasks,One-off use of very high temperatures amidst moderate patterns suggests infrequent but intense thermal tasks like hot cleaning or disinfection.,3,"Highlights infrequent hot tasks at specific times."
Convergence to mid-range values after extremes indicates safety-driven correction,"If users briefly set extremely high or low temperatures and quickly return to mid-range values, it suggests exploratory changes followed by a return to perceived safe levels.",2,"Shows cautious correction with low identity risk."
Multiple distinct temperature modes imply scenario-based usage,Temperature histories that cluster into multiple discrete bands indicate scenario-based use even without explicit labels.,3,"Reveals scenario clusters, moderate identifiability."
Reduced frequency of changes during certain periods signals confidence in defaults,"Time windows where temperature changes are rare, despite frequent activations, indicate that the existing setting is trusted.",2,"Indicates trusted defaults; limited personal detail."
Increased change frequency after configuration updates implies user re-adaptation,A noticeable spike in temperature adjustments after a configuration shift suggests users are re-tuning their comfort levels.,2,"Shows re-adaptation period, modest exposure."
Persistent drift without stabilization suggests inability to find a stable comfort point,"If temperature trends show continuous oscillation or drift without converging, it indicates users have not settled on a comfortable, repeatable setting.",3,"Indicates ongoing discomfort and experimentation."
Distinct morning vs evening temperature ranges indicate dual comfort baselines,"If morning temperatures consistently fall in one range and evening in another, it suggests users maintain different comfort expectations at different times of day.",4,"Exposes dual daily comfort baselines and routines."
