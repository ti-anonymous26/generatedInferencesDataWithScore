inference,Description,score,short rationale
Differentiate true water-use sessions from mere proximity,Compare usage log entries with proximity activation bursts; intervals where proximity is detected but no corresponding usage log entry exists indicate people walking by or standing near the fixture without actually starting a water-use session.,3,"Reveals presence without use, mapping movement around fixtures."
Session start behavior characterization,Measure the time between the first proximity activation and the start time of the corresponding usage log session to understand how quickly users transition from approaching the fixture to actually starting water use.,3,"Shows approach-to-use timing tied to routines."
Session end and lingering presence analysis,Compare the session end times in usage logs with the last proximity activations; proximity persisting after usage ends suggests users linger near the fixture for non-water actions like grooming or conversation.,3,"Captures post-use lingering and timing."
Walk-by versus intentional-use classification,"Short, isolated proximity activations not followed by any usage log entry can be labeled as walk-bys, while proximity bursts that immediately precede and overlap a logged usage session indicate intentional interaction with the faucet or shower.",3,"Differentiates casual pass-by from deliberate use."
User interaction style (intermittent vs continuous),"Within a single usage log session, examine proximity patterns: frequent short activations interspersed with short idle periods indicate intermittent interaction (moving in and out of the sensor zone), while continuous proximity throughout the session suggests the user remains in front of the fixture for the entire duration.",3,"Profiles interaction style during sessions."
Detection of water left running without user nearby,Identify intervals where a usage log session shows water as ‘on’ but proximity activations cease for a significant period; this combination indicates water running while the user is no longer in front of the fixture.,4,"Shows unattended running water and absence timing."
Estimation of non-water task duration within a session,"For each usage session, compare the total session duration with periods of proximity activity; significant stretches with proximity but no recorded water-on time indicate time spent at the sink or shower area doing non-water tasks like lathering with water off.",3,"Reveals in-session behavior (lathering/other tasks)."
Touchless feature adoption measurement,"Check how often session start and end times in usage logs align closely with proximity activations; consistently tight alignment indicates heavy reliance on touchless activation, while misalignment suggests manual controls or hybrid usage.",3,"Indicates control preference and adoption of touchless use."
Queue or crowd presence inference around fixtures,"Clusters of overlapping or back-to-back proximity activations around the start and end of usage log sessions suggest multiple people waiting or moving near a single fixture, useful in public or shared bathrooms.",4,"Exposes crowding/co-occupancy periods."
Child or pet-triggered proximity without full sessions,"Frequent short proximity activations that rarely correspond to full usage sessions in the logs may reveal children or pets triggering sensors without starting a proper water-use event, informing safety and sensitivity tuning.",4,"Infers children/pets presence."
Assessing accessibility or ergonomic issues,"Sessions in the usage logs that show multiple short proximity activations before water finally starts may indicate users struggling to find the correct position or gesture to trigger the sensor, suggesting ergonomic or placement issues.",2,"Shows difficulty interacting, limited identity risk."
Detection of sensor crosstalk between nearby fixtures,"If a usage log session for one fixture overlaps with proximity activations on another nearby fixture without a corresponding usage session there, it may indicate that the second fixture’s sensor is being triggered by users of the first fixture.",2,"Reveals spatial arrangement and movement; low personal detail."
Identification of misaligned or blocked sensors,"Usage log sessions that frequently lack any overlapping proximity activations imply that the sensor may be misaligned, blocked, or malfunctioning, since users are operating the fixture without being detected as present.",1,"Sensor health check with minimal behavioral exposure."
Touchless hygiene compliance in critical spaces,"In environments where touchless operation is preferred, a high ratio of sessions whose start and end times coincide with proximity activations (and low frequency of sessions without proximity) indicates good compliance with touchless hygiene practices.",3,"Profiles compliance patterns in sensitive spaces."
Peak congestion periods around fixtures,"Combine the time distribution of usage log sessions with the frequency of overlapping proximity activations to detect periods when many people are near the fixture, even if only one session is active at a time.",3,"Shows high-traffic windows and co-presence."
Idle presence patterns near fixtures,"Proximity activations extending significantly before or after any nearby usage log sessions reveal people standing or passing time near sinks or showers without using them, which can be relevant for environmental comfort or layout decisions.",3,"Reveals presence windows unrelated to use."
Detection of repeated approach-abort behavior,"Patterns where users approach (proximity activations), do not start a session in the usage logs, and then repeat this behavior within a short period suggest people approaching the fixture, considering use, and backing away—possibly due to unclear UI or poor sensor performance.",3,"Shows hesitation and aborted attempts."
Calibration of auto-off timeouts,"Compare typical durations between the last proximity detection and the end of logged usage; where users remain present but water turns off too early, auto-off timeouts may need to be lengthened, and where water stays on long after proximity ends, timeouts may need to be shortened.",2,"Uses presence timing to adjust controls; modest exposure."
User routine structure around water usage,"By aligning proximity activity before and after each usage log session, the system can identify pre-use and post-use routines, such as users approaching and preparing before turning water on, or staying nearby for grooming after the session ends.",4,"Maps pre/post routines, revealing daily patterns."
Security or after-hours anomaly detection,"Usage log sessions outside normal hours combined with unexpected proximity activations can signal possible unauthorized use of facilities, especially in office or public environments with defined operating times.",4,"Reveals after-hours presence; high privacy/security sensitivity."
Learning curve of users with newly installed sensors,"After installing or changing sensor settings, early usage logs often show scattered, short sessions preceded by multiple proximity activations as users experiment; over time, correlation between proximity and session start stabilizes as users learn how to trigger the sensors effectively.",2,"Shows adaptation period; low identity detail."
Context-aware user identification proxy,"In shared households, distinct patterns of session time, duration (from usage logs), and characteristic proximity patterns (e.g., how long users linger before and after water use) can serve as a proxy to infer likely user identity without explicit tagging.",5,"Enables user re-identification via behavioral patterns."
Detection of policy circumvention behaviors,"If policies require touchless usage, but some sessions appear in usage logs with little or no overlapping proximity activity, this may indicate users bypassing sensor-based activation via manual overrides or alternative controls.",4,"Shows rule-bypassing tied to session timing."
Short proximity-only episodes around long sessions,"Short bursts of proximity activity at the edges of long usage sessions, without additional logged sessions, may indicate assistance or supervision (e.g., a parent briefly entering a bathroom to help a child), which can inform family-use patterns.",4,"Reveals supportive interactions and occupants."
Environment-specific optimization for public vs private settings,"By comparing the ratio of proximity activations to usage log sessions in different locations, the system can infer if public restrooms require tighter detection ranges and shorter timeouts, while private bathrooms benefit from more tolerant proximity-to-use mappings.",2,"Location-level tuning; low individual exposure."
Estimating average user dwell time near fixtures,"For each session, sum the total time from first to last proximity activation, and compare it to session duration from the usage logs; this reveals the full dwell time around water usage, including pre- and post-use intervals.",4,"Captures full presence duration around use."
Identifying fixtures used mainly as pass-through zones,"Fixtures that show many proximity activations but comparatively few usage log sessions likely sit in circulation paths where people frequently pass by but rarely use water, which may influence design or relocation decisions.",2,"Indicates traffic patterns more than identity."
Detection of overlapping sessions and nearby presence,"In multi-fixture environments, overlapping usage log sessions with intertwined proximity activations can indicate simultaneous usage of multiple fixtures in close proximity, revealing patterns of group or family usage.",4,"Exposes co-usage and group presence patterns."
