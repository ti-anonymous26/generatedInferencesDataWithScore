inference,Description,score,short rationale
Validation of session boundaries using flow and proximity,"Compare the start and end times of each usage log session with the first/last proximity activations and the onset/offset of non-zero flow. Consistent alignment across all three signals validates correct session boundaries, while mismatches flag logging or sensor issues.",2,"Checks alignment of logs, flow, and presence; mainly sensor integrity with limited personal detail."
Intentional versus accidental session detection,Identify usage log sessions that begin immediately after one or more proximity activations and show a clear increase in flow. Sessions without preceding proximity or with very small flow suggest accidental or system-triggered usage rather than intentional user actions.,3,"Distinguishes deliberate use from accidental triggers using presence and flow timing, revealing intent."
Latency from user approach to water start,"Measure the time from the first proximity activation indicating a user has approached, to the moment flow rises above a threshold within the corresponding usage log session. This quantifies perceived system responsiveness for hands-free activation.",3,"Captures approach-to-flow timing, modestly exposing user interaction patterns."
Latency from user departure to water stop,"Within each usage session, compute the time between the last proximity activation (user leaving) and the flow rate dropping to near zero, as recorded in both flow history and the session end time. Long delays indicate wasted water after the user leaves.",3,"Measures post-departure flow duration, indicating how users leave water running."
Detection of water left running without user present,Find intervals where a usage log session and high flow continue even though proximity data shows no recent user presence. This indicates taps or showers left running unintentionally or valves stuck open.,4,"Uses lack of presence with ongoing flow to show when water runs unattended, revealing occupancy gaps."
Estimation of active-use fraction within sessions,"For each session in the usage logs, intersect continuous presence intervals from proximity with periods of non-zero flow to estimate the proportion of time when water is actually being used while a user is present, versus water running while the user is away or idle.",3,"Computes how much of a session involves active use with presence, exposing behavior efficiency."
Hands-free versus manual control usage patterns,"Sessions where flow on/off transitions strongly coincide with proximity activations and session boundaries indicate hands-free control, while sessions with weak correlation between proximity, flow, and log times suggest manual faucet control or mixed modes.",3,"Classifies control style from presence/flow correlation, indicating how users operate fixtures."
Queue and crowding detection around fixtures,Identify periods where multiple proximity activations occur back-to-back around overlapping usage log sessions and elevated flow. These three signals together reveal crowding or queue-like behavior around highly used fixtures.,3,"Aggregates proximity and sessions to infer crowding patterns and busy periods."
Classification of walk-bys versus true interactions,"Short proximity activations with no corresponding usage log session and no meaningful change in flow indicate walk-bys, while proximity that precedes a logged session with sustained flow indicates a true interaction with the faucet or shower.",3,"Separates casual passersby from actual use via presence and flow response."
Detection of inefficient user behavior (standing with water on),"Within sessions, locate intervals where proximity indicates user presence and flow is high but the usage log shows no sub-events (such as pauses). Long stretches of presence with high continuous flow suggest potentially wasteful behavior like standing under running water without intermittent shutoff.",4,"Identifies prolonged high flow while present, revealing inefficient personal habits."
Detection of efficient ‘water off while soaping’ behavior,Find periods inside a logged session where proximity indicates user presence but flow history shows near-zero flow. These indicate times when users intentionally turn water off during soaping or scrubbing to conserve water.,4,"Detects deliberate conservation during presence, profiling efficient behavior choices."
Sensor alignment and coverage validation,Sessions with strong flow and clear usage log entries but almost no overlapping proximity activations suggest that the proximity sensor’s field of view is misaligned or too narrow to detect where users actually stand while using water.,2,"Flags proximity coverage gaps; mostly sensor tuning with minimal behavioral inference."
Over-sensitive sensor detection,"Frequent proximity activations outside of any usage log session and without corresponding flow changes highlight over-sensitive sensors that react to passing movement or environmental noise, causing unnecessary sensor activity without real water use.",2,"Identifies nuisance triggers without real use; low direct personal exposure."
Under-sensitive sensor detection,Usage log sessions and significant flow changes that occur with minimal or no proximity activations indicate under-sensitive sensors that fail to reliably detect user presence during normal use.,2,"Reveals missed presence due to sensor insensitivity; limited behavioral detail beyond use occurred."
Detection of repeated approach–abort behavior,"Sequences of proximity activations that do not lead to a usage log session or flow increase, followed by eventual successful activation, suggest users repeatedly approaching and abandoning attempts before finally using the fixture, possibly due to poor sensor UX or confusion.",3,"Shows frustrated attempts and abandonment patterns, modestly exposing user intent."
Separation of cleaning cycles from regular personal use,"Usage logs with multiple short sessions clustered in time, combined with repeated proximity activations and bursts of flow, indicate cleaning routines. These differ from typical personal use, where fewer, longer sessions with more continuous presence are seen.",3,"Distinguishes cleaning routines from personal use, revealing schedule-like behavior."
Verification of automatic shutoff policies,"Within each session, compare configured shutoff timings with actual flow cessation and proximity disappearance. If water often continues to flow after both the usage log end and loss of proximity, automatic shutoff policies may not be working as intended.",2,"Checks policy enforcement via flow and presence end, mainly system compliance."
User dwell time around water usage,"For each session, measure the total interval between first and last proximity activations and compare with the usage log duration and actual flow times. The difference reveals how long users remain near the fixture before and after water usage.",4,"Captures how long users stay near fixtures before/after use, reflecting personal routines."
Identification of supervision or assistance patterns,"Short bursts of proximity activations at the beginning or end of a longer usage log session with continuous flow suggest that another person briefly approached to help (e.g., a parent assisting a child), then left while the main user continued using water.",5,"Infers presence of multiple individuals and assistance, exposing interpersonal interactions."
Detection of policy circumvention behaviors,"If usage logs show sessions during periods where presence-based control should be enforced, but proximity data shows little or no detected presence while flow remains high, this suggests users may be bypassing intended touchless or presence-based policies.",5,"Detects sessions with high flow but missing presence, signaling intentional policy bypass."
Fixture ergonomics and usability ranking,"Compare fixtures by counting how many proximity activations occur before a stable flow and session start are achieved. Fixtures that require many attempts (multiple proximity triggers, small flow bursts) before a session starts likely have poorer ergonomics or sensor placement.",2,"Ranks fixtures by activation effort; operational usability data with limited personal detail."
Detecting multi-user overlap in shared spaces,"Overlapping usage log sessions with interleaved proximity patterns and distinct flow bursts at similar times indicate multiple users interacting with the fixture in quick succession or simultaneously, especially in shared bathrooms or public restrooms.",4,"Reveals simultaneous or rapid multi-user interactions, exposing occupancy patterns."
Distinguishing faucet use from shower use in combined fixtures,"Patterns where proximity activations occur close to the fixture with short sessions and lower flow differ from those involving longer sessions, consistent presence, and higher flow; using all three signals together helps distinguish sink-level use from shower-level use in combined installations.",4,"Differentiates activity types (sink vs shower), revealing personal usage style."
Detection of stuck open valves via presence and logs,Sustained high flow that persists after the usage log session should have ended and after proximity signals disappear suggests a stuck open valve or a malfunctioning shutoff mechanism.,2,"Persistent flow after presence/log end highlights mechanical issue; minimal personal info."
Identifying fixtures used mainly as pass-through zones,"Fixtures associated with many proximity activations but comparatively few usage log sessions and low overall flow volumes are likely located along common paths where people frequently pass by but rarely use water, informing layout changes.",3,"Maps pass-by behavior vs use, indicating movement patterns through space."
Optimization of detection zones for reduced nuisance triggers,"Proximity activations that frequently occur without subsequent sessions or flow within a short time window can be mapped to specific detection angles or distances, guiding adjustments that reduce nuisance triggers while preserving actual usage detection.",2,"Tunes detection zones based on false triggers; limited behavioral exposure."
Estimating behavioral adherence to conservation goals,"Track trends over time in the ratio of flow duration to presence duration within sessions in the usage logs. A decreasing ratio, confirmed by proximity and flow data, indicates improved adherence to conservation behaviors such as turning off water while not actively using it.",4,"Measures conservation habits over time via flow-to-presence ratio, profiling behavior change."
Context-aware classification of short high-flow bursts,"Short bursts of high flow within a longer session, accompanied by continuous proximity and a single usage log entry, can indicate intentional quick rinses during an ongoing task, rather than separate sessions or anomalies.",3,"Interprets brief high-flow bursts with presence as intentional actions within a session."
Detection of sensor crosstalk in multi-fixture environments,"When a usage log and flow history for one fixture overlap with proximity activations recorded at an adjacent sensor but not its own, this pattern indicates sensor crosstalk where users at one fixture are triggering proximity on another.",2,"Identifies proximity triggered from neighboring fixture; sensor artifact with minor personal detail."
Learning curve for new presence-based controls,"After enabling proximity-based activation, early data may show many proximity events with short, aborted sessions and irregular flow. Over time, the correlation between proximity, flow onset, and logged sessions should become smoother, reflecting user adaptation.",3,"Tracks adaptation over time, showing how user interaction patterns evolve with new controls."
Estimating ‘true interaction time’ vs logged session duration,"For each logged session, intersect flow-on intervals with proximity-active intervals to compute how long users actually interacted with water versus how long the session remained open, highlighting over-long logged sessions with brief real interaction.",4,"Computes actual interaction time vs logged duration, revealing over-logged idle periods."
Dynamic adjustment of per-fixture auto-off timeout,Analyze typical gaps between last proximity activation and the last meaningful flow within sessions. Use these patterns to automatically tune auto-off timeouts per fixture to minimize water left running while avoiding premature cutoffs.,2,"Uses aggregate timing gaps to tune auto-off; mostly operational with limited personal exposure."
