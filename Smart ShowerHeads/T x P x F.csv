inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as user-present hot events vs unattended leaks,"Combine each flow anomaly alert window with proximity data and temperature trends; alerts where temperature is elevated and no proximity is detected suggest unattended hot-side leaks, whereas alerts with both high temperature and active presence imply user-driven extreme usage.",4,"Presence plus temperature separate user-driven events from unattended leaks, revealing occupancy windows."
Leak likelihood scoring from absence of presence and elevated temperature,"For every anomaly alert, check for overlapping proximity activations and the temperature level; anomalies with sustained warm or hot temperatures but no nearby presence receive a high leak-likelihood score compared to those occurring during active user presence.",4,"Warm flow without presence signals leaks during idle periods, indicating absence."
Scalding-risk anomaly detection during actual user presence,"Identify anomaly alerts where temperature exceeds a scalding threshold while proximity indicates a user is in front of the fixture, marking those events as high-priority scalding risks rather than harmless high-temperature spikes when no one is present.",4,"Directly ties unsafe temperature to an identified present user."
Cold-shock anomaly detection while user is under the water,"For anomalies where temperature abruptly drops far below the user’s normal range and proximity remains active, classify them as cold-shock anomalies that directly affect the user instead of simple cooling when the area is unoccupied.",4,"Captures cold shocks hitting someone currently present."
Hot-side vs cold-side anomaly localization using presence context,"When anomaly alerts occur with elevated temperatures and no presence, they likely indicate hot-side leaks; anomalies at near-ambient temperatures without presence are more consistent with cold-line leaks, especially if no user-triggered proximity is recorded.",3,"Infers leak side using temperature and absence, modestly revealing occupancy gaps."
Energy waste estimation for unattended hot anomalies,"For anomaly alerts with high temperatures and no proximity, integrate the abnormal hot-water duration and map it to energy consumption, quantifying how much energy is wasted by hot water running when no user is present.",3,"Quantifies hot-water waste during absence; moderate occupancy inference."
Presence-informed anomaly severity ranking,"Rank anomaly alerts by combining presence and temperature: high temperature plus no presence is most severe, moderate temperature with presence is less critical, and low temperature with no presence is mainly a water-loss concern.",3,"Severity driven by presence/temperature context, implying when users are around."
Sensor misalignment detection via comfort anomalies without presence,"If anomaly alerts repeatedly show comfort-range or hot temperatures for extended periods, but proximity never detects presence during those windows, it suggests that users are in the spray zone while sensors are pointed elsewhere or obstructed.",3,"Suggests untracked presence, indicating activity despite missing detections."
Crowd-driven anomaly detection in shared spaces,"Anomaly alerts that coincide with high-frequency or overlapping proximity activations and warm temperature spikes represent crowd-driven anomalies, where intense concurrent use pushes the system into abnormal thermal and flow states.",4,"Reveals co-occupancy crowding patterns and usage peaks."
"Detection of short, risky ‘test blasts’ of hot water","Short anomaly alerts where temperature rapidly spikes to near-scorching levels while proximity shows brief user presence imply users quickly testing how hot water gets, representing risky behavior patterns that may warrant education or stricter limits.",4,"Identifies risky hot tests tied to specific user actions."
Anomaly-triggered user intervention detection,"During anomaly windows, look for bursts of proximity activity followed by a rapid return of temperature to normal ranges; this pattern suggests that users notice abnormal temperature behavior and intervene to adjust or turn off the water.",3,"Observes reaction timing and user responsiveness to anomalies."
Distinguish transient thermal glitches from persistent faults,"Transient anomalies with brief temperature deviations and minimal presence may be minor glitches, whereas repeated anomaly alerts with similar temperature patterns and presence profiles indicate persistent faults that recur under similar user conditions.",2,"Focuses on fault persistence with limited personal detail."
Seasonal pattern of presence-linked hot anomalies,Compare anomaly alerts during periods of active presence across seasons; more presence-linked hot anomalies in colder months versus lukewarm anomalies in hotter months show how environmental temperature interacts with user behavior to generate abnormal usage.,2,"Seasonal trend using coarse presence; low individual sensitivity."
Detection of presence during idle overheating,"Identify periods where temperature drifts upward or stays high, anomaly alerts fire, and proximity sees users nearby but without corresponding strong flow; this may indicate users noticing overheated fixtures even during low or no-flow conditions.",3,"Shows people near overheated fixtures outside active use."
Thermal shock avoidance behavior during anomalies,"Correlate sharp temperature changes during anomaly alerts with changes in proximity; if presence quickly drops when temperature deviates, users are actively avoiding thermal shock, even if water continues to run.",3,"Captures avoidance behavior and timing during unsafe temps."
Short child-associated presence during risky temperature anomalies,"Use shorter, lower-height proximity activations during anomaly alerts with elevated temperatures to infer potential child presence, marking those events as especially sensitive cases where child safety may be at risk.",5,"Infers child presence during high-temp risk, highly sensitive."
Failure of presence-based safety limits during anomalies,"If the system is configured to reduce maximum temperature when presence is detected, anomaly alerts with temperatures above that limit while proximity is active indicate failures in presence-aware safety logic under abnormal conditions.",3,"Shows safety cap failures while users are present."
"Detection of nuisance anomaly alerts due to no-presence, mild temperature",Anomaly alerts that occur during no presence and only mild temperature deviations suggest overly sensitive thresholds or sensor noise; such alerts can be identified as low-priority or false positives to reduce alert fatigue.,1,"Labeling sensor noise with no meaningful personal data."
Identification of thermally unstable fixtures under user load,"If anomaly alerts repeatedly coincide with presence patterns that match normal use, and temperature trends show large swings under those conditions, it indicates fixtures that become thermally unstable when users are present and should be targeted for hardware or control updates.",2,"Highlights fixture instability under use; minor behavioral detail."
Cooldown behavior after hot anomalies with and without presence,"Compare post-anomaly temperature decay under two scenarios—when presence remains and when presence disappears. Slow cooldown with no presence indicates inefficient standby overheating, while fast cooldown during ongoing presence may indicate aggressive mixing responses.",2,"Analyzes cooldown with/without presence; low personal exposure."
Anomaly type taxonomy by presence–temperature signature,"Cluster anomalies based on whether they occur with presence and on the shape and level of temperature curves: ‘hot leak with no presence,’ ‘overheated shower with presence,’ and ‘lukewarm mixing faults’ become distinct categories with different remediation strategies.",3,"Categorizes anomalies using presence/temperature, modestly revealing occupancy context."
Detection of recirculation system issues during idle anomalies,"Anomaly alerts where temperature remains high and flow is low but non-zero, while proximity shows no presence, can indicate misbehaving recirculation loops that keep water hot and slightly moving through pipes unnecessarily.",2,"Operational recirculation issue during absence; low personal detail."
Predictive modeling of high-risk no-presence hot anomalies,"Analyze historical hot anomalies that occurred in periods without presence and identify common temporal or operational patterns; when similar patterns appear again, the system can flag increased risk for upcoming hot leaks or overheating events.",3,"Predicts hot leaks during absence, implying occupancy gaps."
User comfort impact estimation from presence-linked anomalies,"For anomalies where presence is active and temperature deviates significantly from the user’s typical comfort range, estimate the fraction of presence time affected by abnormal temperatures, providing a measure of perceived comfort disruption.",4,"Quantifies discomfort during presence, directly tied to user experience."
Testing effectiveness of acoustic or visual alerts during dangerous anomalies,"Check whether anomaly events with scalding or shock temperatures see an immediate spike in proximity activity and subsequent normalization of temperature; if not, existing alerts may not be noticeable or effective for users during dangerous conditions.",3,"Evaluates user responses to alerts, showing attentiveness and behavior."
Detection of temperature drifts during long no-presence anomalies,"In long anomalies with no presence, monitor whether temperature slowly drifts up or down; gradual heating suggests thermostat drift or misconfiguration, while gradual cooling may suggest a slow leak that is not being replenished with hot water.",2,"Tracks temp drift in absence; minimal personal linkage."
Presence-informed prioritization of maintenance work,Rank fixtures not only by anomaly count but by how many anomalies occur while users are present and at risky temperatures; fixtures with frequent presence-linked dangerous anomalies should be addressed before those with primarily no-presence mild anomalies.,3,"Prioritizes fixtures based on user-present risky anomalies, implying usage patterns."
Detection of intentional high-temperature usage under anomaly conditions,"If anomaly alerts occur repeatedly with elevated temperatures while presence durations are long and stable, it indicates users intentionally running very hot water for extended periods, representing behavioral rather than purely mechanical abnormal usage.",4,"Reveals deliberate very-hot usage tied to individuals."
Validation of temperature caps during anomaly-induced spikes,"During anomaly events where external conditions or internal faults might drive temperature higher, verify that measured temperatures remain under configured caps while presence is active; breaches reveal that caps are not robust during abnormal states.",2,"Checks safety cap performance during presence; low personal sensitivity."
