inference,Description,score,short rationale
Hot-water leak identification with abnormal temperature and flow,"When a flow anomaly alert fires and the flow history shows sustained non-zero flow while temperature remains significantly above the cold baseline, the event can be classified as a hot-water leak rather than a cold-line issue or brief demand spike.",3,"Identifies hot-side leaks using flow/temperature with limited routine detail."
Cold-line or mixed-line anomaly classification,"Flow anomaly alerts that coincide with abnormal flow but show temperature trends near ambient or cold baseline indicate anomalies on cold or mixed lines, distinguishing them from energy-intensive hot-water anomalies.",1,"Line classification with minimal personal exposure."
Scalding-risk anomaly detection under abnormal flow,"If a flow anomaly alert occurs while flow rate is high and temperature spikes above a scalding threshold, the event is tagged as a scalding-risk anomaly, prioritizing it for immediate response over anomalies at safe temperatures.",4,"Flags scalding moments likely affecting users."
Heater capacity stress during anomaly events,"When anomaly alerts occur at very high flow levels and the temperature profile simultaneously drops from normal setpoints, it indicates that the heater is operating beyond its capacity under abnormal demand conditions.",2,"System capacity insight with modest behavioral data."
Energy impact estimation of hot-side anomalies,"For anomaly alerts associated with elevated temperatures, integrate the hot-water portion of the flow during the alert period and convert it to thermal energy usage, quantifying the energy wasted by abnormal hot-water events.",2,"Energy costing of anomalies; limited identity risk."
Differentiation between user-driven extremes and system failures,"Compare flow and temperature patterns during anomaly alerts to typical user-driven peaks; if anomalies show erratic temperature swings or sustained extreme temperatures without the usual user pattern, they are more likely system failures than simply heavy usage.",3,"Separates user extremes from faults using behavior patterns."
Thermostatic mixing valve malfunction under anomalous conditions,"Flow anomaly alerts combined with large, rapid oscillations in temperature while flow remains relatively steady indicate instability in thermostatic mixing valves that only manifests under high or abnormal flow conditions.",1,"Mechanical fault detection with little personal data."
Water-hammer or pressure shock characterization with thermal context,"Short, sharp spikes in flow history that trigger anomaly alerts, accompanied by brief temperature fluctuations, suggest water-hammer events or pressure shocks whose thermal signatures show whether hot or cold lines are primarily affected.",1,"Physical event characterization; minimal behavioral info."
Progressive heater degradation signaled by anomaly–temperature patterns,"A growing number of anomaly alerts where the heater fails to maintain target temperature despite moderate abnormal flows indicates progressive heater degradation, especially if similar flows previously preserved stable temperatures.",2,"System degradation metric with low identity risk."
Seasonal anomaly risk related to temperature extremes,Compare anomaly alerts in different seasons with temperature levels during those events; increases in cold-related anomalies (low temperatures) in winter or overheated anomalies (very high temperatures) in summer reveal seasonal stress on the system.,2,"Seasonal trend; coarse behavioral link."
Pipe freeze-risk anomaly detection,"Anomaly alerts where flow history registers unusual patterns and temperature trends stay near freezing, especially in cold periods, indicate conditions under which pipes are at risk of freezing despite ongoing or recent water movement.",2,"Safety risk flag with limited personal detail."
Anomaly prioritization by combined volume and temperature severity,"Rank anomaly events by integrating abnormal flow volume and weighting it by how far the temperature deviates from normal setpoints (too hot or too cold), focusing maintenance on events that are both high-volume and thermally extreme.",2,"Prioritization metric; low behavioral exposure."
Verification of temperature-limiting safety mechanisms during anomalies,"Check anomaly alerts that occur near the configured maximum allowed temperature; if measured temperatures exceed that limit during abnormal flow, it indicates a failure or misconfiguration of thermal safety mechanisms.",3,"Shows safety limit failures affecting users."
Detection of recirculation or preheat system misbehavior,"Anomalies where elevated temperatures are observed in the flow history even though overall demand should be low, and which correspond to steady low-level abnormal flow, suggest recirculation or preheat systems running unnecessarily.",2,"System misbehavior during low demand; modest identity risk."
Identification of lukewarm anomaly events indicating mixing faults,"Flow anomaly alerts that show abnormal flow accompanied by persistently lukewarm temperatures (mid-range, not near hot setpoints or cold baseline) reveal potential cross-connection or mixing valve issues where hot and cold lines are unintentionally blending.",2,"Mixing fault identification; low personal exposure."
Thermal stress hotspot mapping from repeated hot anomalies,"Repeated anomaly alerts at high temperatures in the same fixture or zone indicate thermal stress hotspots in the plumbing, where pipes and joints are repeatedly exposed to near-maximum temperatures under abnormal flow, raising long-term failure risk.",2,"Infrastructure stress mapping; minimal behavioral data."
Cooldown behavior after hot-water anomalies,"Track how temperature declines after a hot-side anomaly alert as flow returns to normal or stops. Slow cooldown at low or zero flow indicates strong thermal inertia or insulation, while rapid drops suggest exposed or poorly insulated sections.",1,"Cooldown characteristic with negligible personal info."
Validation of anomaly root cause via flow–temperature signature similarity,"Group anomalies based on their joint flow and temperature signatures; similar patterns across multiple events suggest the same underlying root cause, such as a recurring heater control bug or a specific valve problem.",1,"Root-cause grouping; low behavioral impact."
Detection of overheating during low-flow anomalies,"Flow anomaly alerts with modest abnormal flow but high or rising temperatures indicate that the system is overheating water even when usage is low, pointing to control issues or overly aggressive heater settings.",3,"Reveals overheating during low-use periods, implying off-hour risk."
Distinguishing leaks from high-demand hot showers,"Compare anomaly events with user-driven high-flow sessions: leaks often present as long-duration, relatively stable flows at moderately hot temperatures with no typical start/stop pattern, while high-demand showers show more distinctive ramp-up and ramp-down in both flow and temperature.",3,"Separates leaks from user showers using pattern cues."
Identification of temperature overshoot at high abnormal flows,Anomalies where the heater overshoots temperature setpoints during rapid flow increases indicate slow or poorly tuned control loops that fail to handle transient high-flow conditions without overshooting.,2,"Control tuning insight; limited personal detail."
Hot-water anomaly contribution to daily energy footprint,"For all hot-side anomaly alerts in a day, integrate the hot-water portion of flow during those events and convert to energy to estimate what fraction of total daily thermal energy consumption comes from abnormal usage instead of normal operation.",2,"Energy accounting for anomalies; low identifiability."
Detection of mixed hot–cold interactions during anomalies,"Anomalies that feature oscillating temperature between near-cold and near-hot values for a given abnormal flow segment indicate unstable interactions between hot and cold supply lines, possibly due to pressure fluctuations or faulty mixing controls.",2,"Technical mixing issue; minimal personal data."
Evaluation of anomaly threshold tuning using temperature context,"Analyze the temperature spread of events that triggered anomaly alerts versus those that did not; if many alerts occur at benign temperatures with small abnormal flows, thresholds may be too sensitive, while missed events with extreme temperatures indicate thresholds set too loose.",1,"Threshold tuning; negligible personal exposure."
Self-healing behavior detection after anomalies,"For anomaly alerts that are not manually acted upon, observe whether flow and temperature naturally return to normal patterns quickly. Self-recovery without external intervention suggests temporarily unstable operating conditions rather than persistent faults.",1,"Self-recovery observation with little behavioral content."
Detection of heater short-cycling under abnormal demand,Repeated anomaly alerts with short durations where the temperature profile oscillates and flow patterns show bursts of abnormal demand reveal heater short-cycling driven by rapid on/off behavior under high or unstable flow conditions.,2,"System behavior insight; low identity risk."
Predictive indication of future hot-side failures,"A rising count of anomalies that include temperature deviations on the hot side, even at moderate abnormal flows, predicts increasing likelihood of heater, valve, or mixing component failures before catastrophic breakdown occurs.",2,"Predictive maintenance metric; minimal personal detail."
Validation of repair effectiveness using post-anomaly thermal patterns,"Compare the flow and temperature signatures of anomaly alerts before and after maintenance; reductions in extreme temperatures and abnormal volumes during alerts, or a drop in alert frequency, indicate that the underlying issue has been effectively mitigated.",1,"Post-repair validation; negligible behavioral data."
User comfort impact from thermal anomalies,Align anomaly events with periods when temperature profiles indicate typical comfort ranges and flow suggests user presence; anomalies that push temperature outside the comfort band during these intervals are likely to have directly impacted user comfort and satisfaction.,4,"Links anomalies to user-present comfort disruption."
Hot-water recirculation loop imbalance detection,"Anomalies in certain branches where flow is abnormal and temperatures are much higher or lower than in other branches at the same time indicate imbalanced recirculation loops, causing uneven hot-water delivery during abnormal events.",1,"Infrastructure imbalance insight; minimal personal exposure."
Anomaly clustering by temperature band,"Group anomaly alerts according to the temperature range observed during abnormal flow; clusters at very high temperatures represent overheating issues, while clusters at low temperatures may reflect feed water or mixing problems.",1,"Clustering by temperature band with little personal data."
Detection of idle overheating after abnormal use,"After an anomaly event ends, if temperature remains abnormally high despite negligible flow for an extended period, the system may be maintaining excessive standby temperatures due to misconfiguration triggered by the preceding abnormal use.",2,"Shows idle overheating post-event; low behavioral detail."
