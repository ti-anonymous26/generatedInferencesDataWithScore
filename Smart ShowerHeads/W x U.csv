Per-session water volume estimation,"Combine water flow rate history with each usage log interval to integrate flow over time and estimate the total water volume used in each individual session (e.g., liters per shower).",2,Per-session consumption hints at habit intensity with limited identity detail.
Average volume per session type,"Use usage log durations to classify sessions by type (e.g., short vs long events) and combine with integrated flow from flow history to compute typical water volume per type of use, such as quick handwash vs full shower.",2,"Aggregated by type, moderate behavior insight."
Peak demand periods by volume,"Align timestamps from usage logs with summed flow rate data to identify hours or days when the total water volume consumed is highest, rather than just counting the number of sessions.",3,Reveals timing of heavy use windows linked to routines.
High-consumption sessions detection,Compare each session’s integrated volume (from flow history) and duration (from usage logs) to historical averages to flag unusually high-consumption events that may indicate wasteful behavior.,3,Flags specific excessive events tied to user sessions.
Low-efficiency sessions (high flow and long duration),"Identify sessions where both the average flow rate (from flow history) and the duration (from usage logs) are significantly above normal, indicating water-inefficient usage patterns.",3,Highlights inefficient behavior within identifiable sessions.
Potential leaks outside logged usage,"Detect periods where flow history shows non-zero flow but no corresponding usage log entry is recorded, indicating possible leaks, unlogged use, or misconfigured logging.",3,Shows unlogged flow during presumed absence or off-hours.
Data quality or sensor mismatch,"Find cases where usage logs show active sessions but the flow history remains at or near zero, or vice versa, suggesting issues with either the flow sensor or the logging system.",1,Data integrity check with minimal personal exposure.
Baseline daily consumption profile,Combine all sessions from usage logs with integrated volumes from flow history to summarize typical daily water consumption patterns (total volume and number of sessions per day).,3,Daily pattern reveals routine intensity over time.
Behavioral change over time,Track trends in per-session volume and duration jointly by mapping flow-based volume estimates to historical usage logs to see whether users are gradually using more or less water per event.,3,Shows evolving habits across periods.
Impact of water-saving features or policies,"Compare pre- and post-policy periods in usage logs and flow history (e.g., after enabling eco-mode) to determine whether average session duration and per-session volume have declined.",2,Aggregated change tracking with limited personal detail.
Session fragmentation patterns,Use usage logs to identify multiple short sessions close in time and examine their individual volume signatures in flow history to see if users repeatedly turn water on and off instead of one continuous session.,3,Exposes fine-grained on/off behavior around routines.
End-of-session drip detection,"Check for low but non-zero flow in the flow history immediately after a usage log says the session ended, indicating dripping fixtures or valves not fully closing.",2,Minor post-use leakage insight with low identifiability.
Stuck-on or forgotten fixture detection,"Identify very long continuous flow patterns in the flow history that correspond to unusually long entries in usage logs, suggesting a faucet or shower that was accidentally left running.",3,Shows negligence and long unattended use timing.
Away or vacation mode detection,"Use near-zero counts of usage log entries and negligible flow over days to infer that the household or facility is unoccupied, which can be used to trigger special alerting or leak-detection rules.",4,Strongly reveals occupancy/absence periods.
Occupancy intensity estimation,"Combine the number and timing of usage log sessions with the total volume from flow history per day to infer how heavily a bathroom or faucet is being used, which loosely correlates with occupancy intensity.",4,Infers how many occupants or activity level per day.
Optimal automatic shutoff time estimation,"Analyze distributions of session durations from usage logs together with the internal flow patterns within each session from flow history to estimate when water usually stops being meaningfully used, providing a data-driven shutoff timeout.",3,Uses typical session lengths tied to routines.
Fixture performance degradation over time,"Compare average flow rates within sessions of similar duration from usage logs over months; a declining trend in flow at comparable durations suggests pressure loss, clogging, or hardware degradation.",1,Equipment health metric with minimal behavioral detail.
Bunched or queue-like usage periods,"When many usage log entries appear back-to-back, check combined flow signatures during those intervals to confirm high continuous demand, indicating peak times such as morning rush or shared-bathroom queues.",3,Shows peak co-usage periods and routine clustering.
Inefficient handwashing or short-use events,"Identify short-duration sessions in usage logs that still show high average flow in flow history, indicating unnecessarily high flow for quick tasks like handwashing.",2,Reveals inefficient quick-use habits with limited identity risk.
Cleaning or flushing usage detection,"Use patterns of multiple short bursts in flow history inside a single or clustered usage log window to infer cleaning activities, which can be separated from personal hygiene uses.",3,Infers activity type (cleaning vs hygiene) from patterns.
User-level fairness in shared spaces (if users are logged),"If usage logs record user or room identifiers, combine them with per-session volume from flow history to see which users or rooms consume more water, enabling fairness analysis in shared facilities.",5,Directly links consumption to identifiable users/rooms.
Cost or billing estimation per session,Map integrated per-session volume from flow history to usage log entries and apply local water tariffs to estimate the monetary cost of each session and aggregate costs per day or user.,2,Assigns cost to sessions with modest behavioral exposure.
Infrastructure capacity stress analysis,"For systems with multiple fixtures sharing a line, align overlapping usage logs and sum their flow rates from flow history to see when total demand approaches or exceeds recommended plumbing or heater capacity.",2,Shows overlapping demand periods but coarse on individuals.
Potential greywater reuse estimation,"Combine the number and volume of specific types of sessions inferred from usage logs (e.g., showers vs handwashing) with their water volumes from flow history to estimate how much relatively clean water could be captured for greywater reuse.",2,Aggregated by type with low personal identifiability.
Personalized conservation recommendations,"Use each user’s or fixture’s historical combination of session durations (usage logs) and water volumes (flow history) to generate targeted advice, such as reducing shower duration or lowering flow, based on their specific patterns.",3,"Tailors advice to user/fixture patterns, profiling habits."
Event-level flow profile classification,"Within each usage log session, analyze the flow rate shape over time (ramping, pulsed, or steady) to classify how the faucet or shower is being controlled during use, enabling richer behavioral insights than duration alone.",4,Fine-grained control behavior within sessions.
Compliance with allowed usage windows,"Check whether sessions in the usage logs that occur during restricted hours also show significant water volume in the flow history, helping detect non-compliance with scheduled usage policies.",4,Identifies rule-breaking tied to specific times/actors.
Effect of educational prompts or nudges,"Before and after conservation prompts, compare session durations from usage logs and corresponding water volumes from flow history to see if users actually shorten or reduce the intensity of water use.",2,Measures behavior change post-prompts with limited identity detail.
