inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as user-present vs user-absent with thermal context,"Align each flow anomaly alert window with usage log sessions, proximity presence, and temperature trends; alerts that overlap active sessions, elevated temperatures, and continuous presence reflect user-present abnormal events, while alerts with no session, no presence, and stable warm temperatures point to unattended faults or leaks.",4,"Multi-signal context distinguishes occupied events from unattended leaks."
"Leak likelihood scoring using absence of sessions, absence of presence, and warm temperature","For every anomaly alert, check whether there is a concurrent usage session, whether proximity shows a nearby user, and whether temperature is above ambient; anomalies with warm temperatures but no session and no presence receive the highest leak-likelihood scores.",4,"Warm flow plus absence strongly signals leaks during idle times."
Detection of unattended hot-water anomalies in off-hours,"Use usage logs to find time windows with historically minimal sessions, then flag anomaly alerts where temperature is warm and proximity shows no presence; these events indicate hot-water anomalies occurring when the building should be unused.",4,"Exposes off-hour hot anomalies tied to absence schedules."
Scalding-risk anomalies during real usage episodes,"Within usage sessions, isolate anomaly alerts where temperature exceeds scald thresholds while proximity confirms a user is in front of the fixture; these events mark high-priority scalding risk during active use, not just hot water circulating when no one is present.",4,"Captures user-present scalding moments."
Cold-shock anomalies experienced by users,Detect anomaly alerts in active sessions where temperature drops sharply below the user’s typical comfort range while proximity remains active; this combination reveals cold-shock events that users physically experience mid-use.,4,"Highlights cold-shock exposure with user present."
Abnormal session termination due to temperature anomalies,"Find sessions where a temperature-deviation anomaly occurs while presence is detected, followed almost immediately by session end in the logs; such patterns suggest that users terminate usage in response to uncomfortable or dangerous temperature spikes.",4,"Shows user reaction and termination timing."
"Detection of short, extreme ‘test blasts’ of hot water","Identify very short usage sessions that coincide with anomaly alerts and rapid temperature spikes to near-scorching values, with brief proximity presence; these represent risky test blasts where users quickly check the hottest possible water temperature.",4,"Identifies risky behavior with precise timing."
Differentiation between heavy demand and infrastructure failure anomalies,"Compare anomalies overlapping many sessions and dense proximity activity to those with few or no sessions and no presence; the former indicate heavy user-driven demand pushing the system beyond normal operation, while the latter suggest infrastructure failures independent of occupancy.",3,"Separates user-driven stress from vacant failures."
Classification of anomalies into user-misuse vs control-fault categories,"For anomalies occurring in long sessions with continuous presence and extreme or oscillating temperature, treat them as user-misuse if temperatures sit far outside comfort bands by user choice; anomalies where control attempts to stabilize temperature but fails repeatedly indicate control logic or sensor faults.",3,"Distinguishes misuse vs control faults using presence and temp."
Detection of partially logged abnormal usage,"When anomaly alerts coincide with sustained proximity presence and temperature changes, but only a fragment of that period is captured in the usage logs, the system can infer that some abnormal usage is not fully recorded as sessions.",3,"Infers unlogged usage periods tied to presence."
Idle overheating detection with nearby users but no sessions,"Identify periods where temperature increases or remains high, anomaly alerts trigger, proximity indicates people standing nearby, but no usage session is recorded; this suggests that users sense overheating or observe abnormal system behavior without actually starting water use.",3,"Shows nearby presence during idle overheating."
Sensor coverage validation using presence-free comfort anomalies,"Stimulated comfort-like temperature patterns during anomaly alerts, combined with typical session times but no proximity detection, indicate that users are likely present yet undetected, suggesting that the proximity sensor’s coverage is misaligned with where water is actually used.",3,"Infers undetected presence due to sensor blind spots."
Crowd-driven anomaly detection in shared restrooms,"Anomaly alerts that overlap many short usage sessions and dense, overlapping proximity activations, while temperature hovers in warm comfort ranges, indicate that crowd behavior (multiple users cycling through) is driving the system into abnormal conditions.",4,"Reveals crowd-driven abnormal events and co-occupancy."
"Security anomaly detection combining off-hours presence, sessions, and alerts","Anomaly alerts occurring at unusual hours, together with unexpected proximity presence and short or partial usage sessions, suggest possible tampering or unauthorized use of fixtures outside normal operating schedules.",4,"Flags off-hours presence plus anomalies; high security sensitivity."
Detection of repeated approach–alert–retreat cycles,"Look for repeated sequences where proximity appears, a short usage session starts, an anomaly alert fires alongside abnormal temperature, and proximity vanishes quickly; repeated cycles indicate fixtures that fail early in use, prompting users to abort immediately.",3,"Captures abortive attempts and user reactions."
Short child-associated presence during dangerous anomalies,"Use characteristic proximity patterns (shorter presence, possibly lower height if available) and the timing of anomaly alerts with extreme temperatures inside sessions to flag events where children may have been exposed to dangerous conditions, even if sessions are brief.",5,"Infers child presence during dangerous temperature events."
Detection of leaks triggered after normal sessions,"Identify anomaly alerts that begin shortly after a normal-looking session ends in the logs, when proximity has disappeared and temperature remains elevated; this pattern suggests valves that fail to fully close, leading to leaks only after users have left.",4,"Shows post-session leaks tied to absence."
Normalization of anomaly rate by occupancy and use,Compute fixture-level anomaly counts over time and normalize by total session duration from usage logs and total proximity presence; a high anomalies-per-hour-of-use ratio highlights fixtures that are abnormally problematic given how often they are actually used.,2,"Aggregate rate metric with limited personal detail."
Detection of nuisance anomaly alerts due to mild deviations,Anomalies that repeatedly occur during normal sessions with minor temperature deviations and typical presence patterns likely represent overly sensitive thresholds; these can be tagged as nuisance alerts requiring configuration tuning.,1,"Low sensitivity to personal data; mostly noise labeling."
Identification of chronic warm-side leaks in low-usage periods,"During periods with few or no sessions, find anomaly alerts where temperature remains mildly warm and no proximity is recorded; repeated mild warm anomalies in these windows reveal chronic, small hot-water leaks that slowly waste energy.",4,"Exposes chronic warm leaks during absence windows."
Routine-level anomaly impact scoring on comfort,"For recurring session patterns (e.g., nightly showers), count how often anomaly alerts occur while proximity is active and temperature deviates from the routine’s usual comfort range; this yields a per-routine comfort disruption score that can inform targeted interventions.",3,"Ranks comfort disruption per routine, profiling habits."
Time-of-day anomaly risk profiling,"Combine anomaly timestamps with session timing from logs, temperature deviations, and presence density; some time windows (like early mornings with simultaneous showers) may show a higher probability of user-present hot or cold anomalies than others.",3,"Profiles risk by daypart using occupancy and temp."
Thermal control overshoot detection under user load,"In sessions that align with anomaly alerts, track whether temperature temporarily overshoots above the user’s typical comfort range when heating responds to demand; frequent overshoots during normal presence indicate aggressive control loops that need retuning.",3,"Shows overshoot under user load and timing."
Detection of lukewarm mixing anomalies under normal use,Anomalies that occur inside sessions while proximity is active and temperature stays stuck at lukewarm (neither comfort-hot nor cold) suggest cross-connection or mixing valve faults that prevent users from achieving their desired temperature.,3,"Identifies mixing faults during active use."
Presence-aware prioritization of anomaly repairs,"Rank fixtures by how often anomaly alerts overlap both active sessions and presence, weighted by deviation of temperature from comfort; fixtures with frequent user-present anomalies at extreme temperatures receive higher repair priority than those with anomalies when no one is around.",3,"Prioritizes based on user-present extreme events."
Detection of energy-wasting high-temperature flushing routines,"Find sequences of short sessions where temperature is repeatedly driven to high levels during anomaly alerts, with brief presence bursts; these patterns suggest unnecessary high-temperature flushing that wastes energy without corresponding comfort use.",3,"Reveals wasteful high-temp routines tied to behavior."
Testing effectiveness of user-facing anomaly notifications,"After anomaly alerts that trigger user-visible warnings, check whether proximity activity increases (user approaches the fixture) and whether active sessions end or temperatures return to normal; poor correlation suggests alerts are not effective at prompting corrective user action.",3,"Measures responsiveness to alerts using presence and session timing."
Detecting mis-scheduled automation that conflicts with real use,"When scheduled operations cause anomaly alerts with elevated temperature at times the building is expected to be empty, but logs show sporadic sessions and presence, the mismatch highlights automations that clash with actual user behavior and create anomalies.",3,"Highlights automation vs occupancy mismatches."
Self-resolving anomaly pattern without user interaction,"Identify anomaly alerts that start and end during periods with no sessions and no proximity, yet show temperature and system parameters returning to normal automatically; these events indicate transient system states that self-correct but may portend future issues if frequent.",2,"Self-resolving system behavior with minimal personal data."
Behavioral change in response to past anomalies,"Compare session durations, temperature choice, and presence patterns before and after a cluster of anomalies; shorter sessions or more cautious temperature settings in later periods suggest users adapted their behavior because of prior abnormal events.",3,"Shows behavioral adaptation linked to anomalies."
Context-aware anomaly escalation based on vulnerable session types,"Use usage patterns and presence signatures to infer vulnerable sessions (such as those likely involving children or elderly users), then escalate anomaly alerts that overlap those sessions and show significant temperature deviations more aggressively than in general cases.",5,"Infers vulnerable users (children/elderly) to escalate events."
Predictive detection of high-risk upcoming sessions from early cues,"Train models using early portions of sessions (initial proximity behavior, early temperature ramp, and historical anomaly overlaps) to predict which in-progress sessions are likely to trigger anomaly alerts, allowing the system to watch them more closely or intervene early.",4,"Predicts risky sessions from early behavioral cues."
