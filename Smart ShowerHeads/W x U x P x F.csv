inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as in-session with presence vs out-of-session leaks,"Align each flow anomaly alert window with usage log sessions, continuous flow from the flow rate history, and proximity activations; alerts that overlap a logged session and active presence indicate user-driven abnormal use, while alerts with sustained flow but no session and no proximity point to true leaks.",4,"Combines sessions, flow, and presence to flag activity vs leaks, revealing occupancy windows."
"Leak likelihood scoring from session gaps, flow patterns, and lack of presence","For every anomaly alert, check whether a usage session is active, whether the flow history shows persistent abnormal flow, and whether proximity detects anyone nearby; alerts with long abnormal flow, no session in the logs, and no presence get a high leak-likelihood score.",4,"Absence of sessions/presence with abnormal flow signals leaks during empty periods, exposing occupancy."
Detection of water left running after the user leaves,"Within a usage session, find anomaly alerts where flow remains high in the history after the last proximity activation and near the end of the session in the logs, indicating water has been left running or a valve stuck open once the user has walked away.",4,"Tracks departure times and ongoing flow, showing when individuals leave water running."
Detection of unlogged abnormal sessions,"When anomaly alerts coincide with substantial flow in the history and sustained proximity presence but there is no corresponding usage session in the logs, it suggests that abnormal water use is occurring without being properly recorded as a session.",4,"Presence plus flow without logs uncovers unrecorded user sessions and activity timing."
Crowd-driven anomaly detection in shared facilities,"Anomaly alerts that overlap time windows with many short usage sessions, elevated aggregate flow, and dense overlapping proximity activations indicate that crowd behavior in shared restrooms is pushing the system into abnormal high-demand states.",3,"Aggregated crowding patterns from sessions, flow, and proximity reveal high-traffic periods."
Single-user misuse vs mechanical failure discrimination,"If an anomaly alert aligns with one extended usage session in the logs, steady high flow, and continuous proximity for a single user, the event is more likely misuse (deliberately running water) than a mechanical failure that would persist without presence or session changes.",4,"Continuous presence with one session attributes anomalies to a specific user's misuse."
Estimating user disruption from anomaly events,"For each anomaly alert, measure the overlap between the alert window, active usage sessions, continuous flow segments, and proximity presence; a larger overlap fraction indicates greater direct disruption to users compared to anomalies that occur when no one is present and no session is active.",3,"Overlap of anomalies with presence and sessions gauges direct user impact and engagement windows."
Idle-period anomaly criticality assessment,Use usage logs to identify time windows with historically low or no sessions; anomaly alerts occurring in these windows that show sustained abnormal flow and no proximity activity highlight critical unattended faults more serious than anomalies during busy hours.,4,"Highlights anomalies during low-activity periods, inferring when spaces are unoccupied."
Sensor coverage validation using anomaly–session mismatches,"Repeated anomaly alerts where flow is clearly abnormal and sessions in the logs show use, but proximity rarely detects presence, indicate that the proximity sensor’s field of view does not adequately cover where users actually stand during abnormal flow events.",2,"Finds gaps between presence and use, mainly sensor calibration with little behavioral detail."
Detection of sensor crosstalk in multi-fixture environments,"If an anomaly alert corresponds to abnormal flow and an active usage session at one fixture but the strongest proximity activations are recorded at an adjacent fixture, this pattern suggests proximity sensor crosstalk where users at one fixture are triggering another sensor.",2,"Identifies proximity triggered by adjacent fixtures; operational sensor issue with minimal user data."
Queue and congestion-related anomalies,"Combine anomaly alerts with spikes in total flow history, overlapping usage sessions, and many back-to-back proximity activations to identify anomalies caused by queues or congestion around fixtures, where many users cluster and stress the system.",3,"Uses overlapping sessions, flow, and dense presence to infer crowding patterns."
Auto-shutoff effectiveness during anomalies,"For anomalies where automatic shutoff is expected, examine whether flow in the history drops quickly to baseline, the associated usage session ends in the logs, and proximity presence disappears after the alert; if flow and sessions persist, auto-shutoff is not effectively resolving abnormal events.",2,"Checks flow drop, session end, and presence disappearance; focused on control efficacy not behavior."
Detection of repeated approach–alert–retreat cycles,"Look for patterns where proximity logs show users approaching, a brief usage session starts, an anomaly alert fires with an abnormal flow spike, and proximity then disappears; repeated cycles of this pattern point to fixtures that malfunction early in use and cause users to retreat.",3,"Patterns of approach and retreat expose how users abandon fixtures after alerts."
Segregation of occupancy-driven anomalies from infrastructure faults,Compare anomaly frequency during periods of high occupancy (many sessions and rich proximity activity) to low-occupancy periods; anomalies with abnormal flow that persist even when logs and proximity show little activity are more likely infrastructure faults than occupancy-driven spikes.,3,"Compares anomalies in high vs low occupancy to attribute cause, revealing busy vs quiet periods."
Normalization of anomaly rates by actual usage and presence,"For each fixture, compute anomaly counts and normalize them by total session duration from usage logs, total flow volume from the history, and total proximity presence time; a high anomaly-per-hour-of-use ratio reveals fixtures that behave abnormally relative to how often they are used.",3,"Rates anomalies per use and presence time, profiling fixtures relative to actual user exposure."
Detection of unattended abnormal operation in off-hours,Align anomaly alerts with off-hours in the usage logs and inspect flow and proximity; alerts where flow remains abnormal while there are no sessions and no presence indicate unattended abnormal operation that would otherwise remain unnoticed.,4,"Flags anomalies with no sessions or presence during off-hours, revealing absence schedules."
Detection of deliberate policy circumvention behaviors,"If policies require that water only flows when presence is detected and a session is active, anomaly alerts where flow history shows high use and a session is logged but proximity remains minimal suggest that users may be bypassing or covering presence sensors.",5,"Detects sessions with flow but little presence, indicating users bypassing sensors and policies."
Prioritization of anomalies that disrupt many distinct users,Count how many separate usage sessions and distinct proximity episodes overlap each anomaly alert; anomalies that intersect many short sessions and presence bursts disrupt more users and should be prioritized for remediation over those affecting a single rare user.,3,"Counts distinct sessions and presence per anomaly, indicating how many users are impacted."
Self-resolving anomaly pattern detection without user intervention,"Identify anomaly alerts where abnormal flow in the history quickly returns to normal patterns and no new proximity activity or session start/stop occurs at the end of the alert, indicating a transient system state that self-corrects without human intervention.",2,"Finds anomalies that clear without new presence or session changes; limited personal exposure."
Differentiating abnormal cleaning cycles from leaks,"Anomalies that overlap clusters of short usage sessions, intermittent proximity movement around fixtures, and fluctuating flow suggest abnormal cleaning cycles, whereas anomalies with steady abnormal flow, no sessions, and no presence indicate leaks or remote actuation faults.",3,"Uses clustered short sessions and proximity movement to spot cleaning routines versus leaks."
Dynamic adjustment of anomaly thresholds using usage and presence context,"Use historical correlations between anomaly alerts, session intensity, flow variability, and presence density to tune thresholds: allow more variance in flow during high-usage periods with many active sessions and presence, and tighten thresholds during expected quiet periods.",2,"Tunes thresholds from aggregated usage, flow, and presence patterns; low individual detail."
Security anomaly detection combining off-hours presence and alerts,"Anomaly alerts that occur at unusual hours together with unexpected proximity activity and short, irregular usage sessions may signal security issues such as tampering, vandalism, or unauthorized use of fixtures.",5,"Combines off-hour alerts with unexpected presence, directly revealing unauthorized occupancy or tampering."
Detection of valves reopening after session end and user departure,"Find anomaly events where flow returns to baseline when the session ends and proximity disappears, but later the flow history shows renewed abnormal flow and an anomaly alert while no new session or presence is recorded, indicating valves that reopen on their own.",3,"Looks for renewed abnormal flow after users depart, inferring post-departure issues."
Anomaly clustering by presence–session signature,"Cluster anomalies into categories such as: no session and no presence (likely leaks), session without presence (policy circumvention or sensor failure), and session with strong presence (user-driven misuse or overloaded fixtures), based on overlapping patterns in logs, flow, and proximity.",3,"Categorizes anomalies by presence/session combinations, distinguishing leaks from user-driven misuse."
Testing effectiveness of user-facing anomaly notifications,"For anomalies that trigger user-visible or audible alerts, check whether proximity around the fixture increases and whether ongoing usage sessions end or flow normalizes soon afterward; a weak response pattern suggests notifications are not effective at prompting corrective action.",4,"Measures behavior change after alerts via presence and session endings, profiling responsiveness."
Early identification of fixtures prone to user-present anomalies,"Analyze how often anomaly alerts coincide with active sessions and proximity at each fixture; fixtures with a disproportionate share of user-present anomalies, relative to total usage, may have poor ergonomics or control logic issues that create abnormal states during normal use.",3,"Correlates anomalies with presence and sessions per fixture, showing user-involved problem spots."
Predictive detection of high-risk sessions from early flow and presence cues,"Examine the early part of sessions—initial flow ramp in the history, early proximity re-triggers, and historical anomaly overlaps—to predict which sessions are likely to produce anomaly alerts later, allowing the system to monitor them more closely or pre-emptively intervene.",4,"Predicts which active sessions will go abnormal from early flow and presence, inferring near-term user behavior."
"Validation of occupancy models with anomaly, session, and presence data","Compare building-level expected occupancy with actual proximity and session activity during anomaly alerts; anomalies occurring when models predict occupancy but logs and proximity show little use reveal model mismatches, whereas anomalies in predicted idle periods reinforce concerns about leaks.",4,"Compares expected vs actual occupancy via sessions and presence during anomalies, exposing true occupancy patterns."
Quantifying unobserved risk from anomalies when users are absent,Aggregate anomaly alerts that occur with sustained abnormal flow but without overlapping sessions or proximity; the total duration and frequency of these events represent the risk and potential damage of abnormal water usage that nobody is present to notice.,3,"Aggregates anomalies without sessions or presence to measure unattended risk and vacancy windows."
Context-aware escalation of anomalies based on affected usage patterns,"Use usage logs and proximity patterns to categorize sessions (e.g., long routine showers vs brief handwashing), then escalate anomaly alerts more aggressively when they overlap high-value or vulnerable usage types that involve extended presence and high flow.",4,"Classifies session types to escalate alerts, profiling user habits like long showers or brief handwashing."
Detection of fixtures mainly causing anomalies under heavy occupancy,Cross-tabulate anomaly alerts with periods of heavy occupancy derived from many sessions and rich proximity activity; fixtures whose anomalies strongly cluster in these high-occupancy windows are particularly sensitive to crowd load and may require hardware upgrades.,3,"Links anomalies to high-occupancy periods, showing crowd-driven fixture stress."
Detection of anomalies linked to specific cleaning schedules,Align maintenance or cleaning windows (from external schedules or characteristic session and presence patterns) with anomaly alerts and flow deviations; repeated anomalies in these periods indicate that cleaning procedures or tools may be stressing the fixtures abnormally.,3,"Aligns anomalies with cleaning schedule patterns, revealing maintenance routines."
Recovery time analysis after severe anomalies,"For severe anomaly alerts with large abnormal flow, compute how many subsequent usage sessions and presence episodes are needed before flow patterns in the history return to their normal envelopes, giving a measure of system recovery time for each fixture.",2,"Tracks sessions and presence needed for flows to normalize post-event; mostly operational timeline."
