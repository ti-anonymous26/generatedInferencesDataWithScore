inference,Description,score,short rationale
Classify anomalies as in-session hot-water events vs off-session leaks,"Align each flow anomaly alert with usage log sessions and temperature trends; alerts that overlap long hot-water sessions in the logs likely reflect extreme but intentional usage, while alerts outside any logged session with elevated temperatures suggest hot-side leaks when the system should be idle.",4,"Combines sessions and temperature to expose occupancy vs unattended leaks."
Leak likelihood scoring with thermal and session context,"For each anomaly alert, check if a usage session is active and whether temperature is in a typical comfort range. Alerts with no overlapping session and stable hot or lukewarm temperatures during the anomaly are given a high leak-likelihood score, distinguishing them from user-driven spikes.",4,"Absence plus warm temps highlight likely leaks during idle periods."
Night-time anomaly criticality under low expected use,"Use usage logs to identify hours with historically low or no sessions; anomaly alerts in these windows, especially when temperature trends show hot or warm water during the event, are critical indicators of off-hour leaks or failures rather than normal usage.",4,"Reveals off-hour hot events tied to absence."
Mapping anomalies to specific session types,"When anomaly alerts overlap usage sessions, examine the sessions’ duration from logs and their temperature profiles to determine which types of sessions (e.g., long hot showers vs short warm handwashing) tend to trigger abnormal usage patterns.",3,"Links anomalies to session types and routines."
Detection of forgotten hot showers after users leave,"Identify long usage sessions where anomaly alerts occur near the tail end, and temperature remains high even as session duration exceeds typical patterns; this combination indicates showers left running unintentionally rather than short, deliberate hot-water uses.",4,"Shows unattended hot flow after users depart."
Scalding-risk anomaly episodes in real usage windows,"Within logged sessions, detect anomaly alerts where temperature briefly or persistently exceeds a safety threshold; these represent scalding-risk episodes during actual user use, distinct from harmless high-temperature anomalies when no session is active.",4,"Captures user-present scalding risk moments."
Session-end anomaly association due to thermal discomfort,"Look for anomaly alerts that coincide with abrupt changes in temperature during active sessions and are followed quickly by session termination in the logs, suggesting that temperature-related anomalies cause users to end their showers or faucet use early.",4,"Reveals user reactions and early termination timing."
Detection of system overshoot during intense sessions,"For long, hot sessions in the usage logs, check whether anomaly alerts correspond to temperature overshoots relative to users’ usual comfort range; repeated overshoot anomalies in these sessions indicate thermal control issues under sustained demand.",3,"Shows overshoot during intense routines."
Seasonal anomaly pattern characterization,Compare anomaly alert frequency and associated temperature levels across seasons for similar session types in the logs; more hot-side anomalies in winter and more lukewarm anomalies in summer reveal how environmental conditions interact with user behavior to create abnormal usage.,2,"Seasonal trend with coarse behavioral signal."
Short-session anomaly detection indicating extreme behaviors,"Identify anomaly alerts that occur within very short sessions in the logs, especially when temperature rises or falls rapidly; these events indicate intense or unusual behaviors (e.g., rapid high-temperature bursts) rather than the longer patterns expected for typical showers.",3,"Highlights unusual extreme behaviors in short sessions."
Differentiating heater failures from user misconfiguration,"When anomaly alerts coincide with sessions where temperature never reaches the user’s typical comfort range despite normal or extended durations in the logs, the pattern suggests heater or supply failures rather than simple user misconfiguration of temperature.",2,"Fault vs user config with limited identity."
Detection of excessive hot-water use during specific routines,"Find recurring usage sessions with similar start times and durations that frequently coincide with anomaly alerts and elevated temperatures; these patterns indicate specific routines (e.g., nightly long hot showers) that consistently push usage into abnormal territory.",4,"Profiles routines that drive excessive hot use."
Assessment of auto-shutoff or cap policies on anomalies,"Before and after implementing temperature caps or session-duration limits, compare how many anomaly alerts occur within long hot sessions in the logs; a drop in hot-related anomalies linked to extended sessions indicates that policies are effective at limiting abnormal use.",2,"Policy effectiveness check with limited personal data."
Identification of mild anomalies with negligible user impact,"Some anomaly alerts may occur in short or moderate sessions where temperature deviates only slightly from normal comfort ranges. When these events align with typical session patterns in the logs, they can be classified as low-impact anomalies requiring less aggressive mitigation.",1,"Low impact and minimal personal exposure."
Detection of prolonged warm-water anomalies during idle periods,Use usage logs to find windows with no expected sessions and temperature trends to identify persistent warm-water levels; anomaly alerts in these windows reveal prolonged abnormal warm-water flow that does not correspond to any logged user activity.,4,"Exposes prolonged warm flow during absence windows."
Anomaly type taxonomies via temperature and session context,"Cluster anomaly alerts based on whether they occur during or outside usage sessions and on the temperature patterns observed—very hot, lukewarm, or near-cold—to build a taxonomy of anomaly types like overheated shower events, lukewarm mixing faults, and cold leaks.",2,"Categorization with limited personal detail."
Evaluation of anomaly detection thresholds using log-based baselines,"Use usage logs and associated temperature profiles to establish normal ranges for specific session types; anomaly alerts that frequently fire in these normal ranges indicate thresholds set too aggressively, while missing alerts for clearly abnormal temperature–duration patterns indicate thresholds set too loosely.",1,"Threshold tuning; negligible behavioral risk."
Detection of partially logged anomalous usage,"Anomaly alerts where part of the abnormal temperature period overlaps a recorded session and part falls outside any logged session indicate that some usage is not properly tracked in the logs, revealing logging gaps or unmonitored control paths.",3,"Shows unlogged usage spanning sessions."
High-energy anomaly impact scoring per routine,"For each recurring routine inferred from usage logs (time and duration), count associated anomaly alerts and examine whether temperatures are near or above comfort setpoints. Routines with frequent hot anomalies represent high-energy, high-impact patterns that merit targeted feedback.",3,"Ranks routines by energy-heavy anomalies."
Night vs day anomaly impact on comfort,"Compare anomaly alerts inside usage sessions that occur at night vs day, focusing on whether temperature deviates from comfort ranges; night-time hot anomalies in long sessions may matter more for user comfort and energy use than similar anomalies during quick morning uses.",3,"Contrasts comfort impact by daypart."
Recovery behavior after hot-water anomalies in sessions,"When hot-temperature anomalies occur during sessions, track how quickly temperature returns to the user’s typical comfort range and whether the session continues or ends; rapid recovery with continued use suggests a resilient system, whereas extended deviation or early termination indicates poor recovery.",3,"Shows recovery timing and user continuation."
Detection of chronic warm-side leaks using low-session periods,"Examine low-usage periods in the logs (e.g., mid-day in an empty home) and look for anomaly alerts tied to slightly elevated temperatures; such patterns expose chronic warm-side leaks that do not align with any regular usage session.",4,"Reveals warm leaks during expected absence."
Long-term anomaly trend normalized by session count,"Track the number of anomaly alerts over time while normalizing by the number and duration of usage sessions; an increasing ratio of anomalies per hour of use, especially with associated temperature deviations, indicates degrading system health.",2,"Aggregated health metric with minimal identity risk."
Identification of misconfigured hot-water presets,"If many anomaly alerts occur during sessions where temperature consistently sits above typical comfort ranges for similar durations, it suggests that hot-water presets or thermostat settings are misconfigured to unnecessarily high values.",3,"Indicates habitually high presets tied to users."
Context-aware anomaly escalation for vulnerable users,"Use session timing and duration from logs (e.g., early evening baths) and temperature levels during anomalies to determine when events might affect children or elderly users; anomalies in those contexts with high temperatures are escalated more aggressively than similar anomalies in low-risk sessions.",5,"Infers vulnerable users (children/elderly) and escalates."
Thermal stress cycles detection in frequently used fixtures,"For fixtures with many usage sessions, detect anomaly alerts that correspond to temperature cycling between high and low values under abnormal usage; repeated thermal stress cycles during these sessions indicate higher long-term risk of material fatigue or failure.",2,"Technical stress insight with low personal exposure."
Detection of mixed hot–cold anomalies during multi-phase sessions,"In long sessions where users shift from hot to cooler temperatures, anomaly alerts that coincide with rapidly changing temperatures suggest unstable mixing or pressure balancing issues that arise when users transition between phases.",2,"Technical mixing issue within sessions; limited identity."
Estimating unobserved energy waste from off-session hot anomalies,Sum thermal energy implied by elevated temperatures during anomaly alerts that occur while no session is active in the logs to estimate the energy wasted by hot-water anomalies not tied to any legitimate user activity.,3,"Quantifies off-session hot waste linked to idle periods."
Validation of repair effectiveness from anomaly and session patterns,"After a repair, compare anomaly frequency, associated temperature deviations, and which session types they occur in to pre-repair data. A drop in hot-related anomalies during long sessions or the elimination of off-session warm anomalies indicates effective mitigation.",2,"Post-repair effectiveness with minimal behavioral data."
Detection of comfort-driven behavior changes after anomalies,"Following a period with noticeable hot or cold anomalies during sessions, examine subsequent usage logs and temperature choices; if users shorten sessions or choose milder temperatures, it suggests that prior anomalies altered their comfort expectations or trust in the system.",3,"Shows behavioral adaptation after anomalies."
Anomaly clustering by routine-based temperature bands,"Cluster anomaly events by the typical session type (from logs) and the temperature range observed during the alert. This reveals which routines—such as very hot, long showers vs moderate, shorter uses—are most prone to generating abnormal usage patterns.",3,"Profiles routines prone to anomalies."
Early-warning indicator from rising mild anomaly counts in specific routines,"Track mild anomaly alerts (small temperature deviations, short abnormal periods) within specific recurring session types; a rising count of such mild anomalies may be an early warning sign of future severe anomalies or equipment wear in those routines.",2,"Early warning metric with limited personal detail."
