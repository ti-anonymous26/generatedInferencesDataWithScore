inference,Description,score,short rationale
Pre-heating behavior detection,Align proximity activation times with temperature trends to detect when users stand near the fixture waiting for water to reach a comfortable temperature before fully engaging with it.,3,"Shows waiting near fixture and warm-up timing tied to routines."
User patience threshold for warm water,Measure how long proximity is sustained before temperature enters the user’s typical comfort range; repeated patterns reveal how long users are willing to wait for warm water before giving up or changing behavior.,3,"Reveals tolerance and start-of-use timing."
Idle heating with no user present,"Identify periods where temperature rises or remains elevated while there is no proximity activation, indicating water is being heated or maintained hot even though no one is near the fixture.",2,"Highlights absence with unnecessary heating; limited identity."
Approach–adjust–use pattern classification,"Detect sequences where proximity activation is followed by rapid temperature changes, indicating that users approach, adjust temperature while present, and then settle into a stable comfort range.",3,"Captures detailed interaction sequence around use."
Comfort-seeking adjustment frequency,"Within intervals of continuous proximity, count how often temperature is adjusted up or down; frequent adjustments suggest users struggle to find a comfortable temperature or that the system is thermally unstable near the user.",3,"Shows comfort-seeking behavior during sessions."
Safety-aware temperature limiting for children,"When proximity patterns suggest smaller/shorter presence (e.g., child-height sensor placement) and temperature trends approach unsafe levels, the system can infer a need for stricter maximum temperature limits while children are present.",4,"Infers presence of children and safety context."
Detection of ‘set-and-leave’ behavior,"Find cases where users trigger proximity once, set a temperature that quickly stabilizes, then exhibit little additional proximity activity; this pattern reflects users who prefer a fixed, stable temperature with minimal ongoing interaction.",3,"Profiles stable set-and-forget preference."
Temperature ramp-up experience quality,"Compare the temperature curve during periods of continuous proximity at session start to see whether users experience a smooth warm-up or a slow, jagged ramp, which influences perceived comfort and system quality.",2,"Experience quality insight with modest behavior detail."
Avoidance of extreme temperatures while present,"Detect whether temperature excursions to very hot or very cold values mainly occur when proximity is absent, indicating that users instinctively move away from the fixture when temperature moves beyond their comfort zone.",2,"Shows avoidance behavior with low identifiability."
Pre-arrival preheating patterns,"Identify cases where temperature increases toward a comfort range shortly before proximity is detected, suggesting automated or scheduled preheating timed to anticipated user arrival.",4,"Signals anticipated arrival times and routine scheduling."
Presence-only (no-temp-change) behavior,"Look for intervals with sustained proximity activation while temperature remains nearly flat, indicating that users are near the fixture but not interacting with temperature controls, possibly performing other tasks.",3,"Reveals presence and near-fixture activity without adjustments."
Thermal-shock avoidance behavior,"Correlate rapid temperature drops or rises with changes in proximity; users who quickly leave or reduce presence during large temperature swings are likely reacting to thermal shock, indicating poor thermal stability.",3,"Captures reactions and timing to discomfort."
Preferred temperature ranges when user is actively present,"Filter temperature data to spans where proximity is active, and derive the most common temperature ranges during presence; these ranges represent true comfort zones rather than idle or background temperatures.",4,"Directly infers personal comfort temperatures."
Inefficient warm-up with user waiting nearby,"Find intervals where proximity is maintained for a long time while temperature remains far from typical comfort levels, highlighting inefficiencies where users wait unnecessarily long for water to reach the desired temperature.",3,"Shows wait duration and start-of-session behavior."
Post-use lingering near warm fixtures,"Proximity that continues after temperature starts to decrease toward baseline suggests users linger near the fixture after turning water off, possibly enjoying residual warmth or finishing related tasks.",3,"Reveals post-use lingering habits and timing."
Correlation between long presence and high temperature use,"Compare presence duration (from proximity) with average temperature during those periods; longer presence associated with higher temperatures may indicate long, hot showers or baths and potential energy-saving opportunities.",4,"Links long presence with hot use, profiling routine intensity."
Detection of pre-use safety check behavior,"Proximity activation followed by short bursts of temperature adjustments without full, sustained heating suggests users are briefly checking or testing water temperature for safety (e.g., for children or sensitive skin).",3,"Shows cautious pre-use checks tied to safety."
Seasonal comfort presence patterns,"Relate proximity-active periods with temperature choices across seasons to reveal whether users spend more time near fixtures at higher temperatures in winter and shorter, cooler-temperature interactions in summer.",2,"Seasonal preference trends with coarse identifiability."
Temperature stability during continuous presence,Measure temperature variance only during continuous proximity intervals; high variance when users are present points to poor control and a need for better mixing or heater regulation.,2,"Stability metric during presence, limited behavioral detail."
Detection of presence in unsafe temperature zones,"Identify instances when proximity indicates a user is present while temperature remains above an unsafe threshold for a sustained time, highlighting periods of elevated scalding risk.",4,"Shows presence during unsafe temps, strong safety/privacy signal."
Recognition of ‘quick warm rinse’ patterns,"Short proximity intervals paired with rapid temperature increase to a moderately warm range and quick decline indicate swift warm rinses, distinct from full-length showers or extended use.",3,"Identifies quick-use patterns and timing."
Temperature adjustment style classification,"During continuous proximity, analyze the pattern of temperature changes—single large adjustments vs many small tweaks—to classify users as decisive or incremental adjusters, which can inform UI hints or presets.",3,"Profiles adjustment style linked to individuals."
Detection of unused hot-water availability,"Periods where temperature remains high but proximity is absent reveal that the system is maintaining hot water when no one is nearby to use it, showing opportunities to trim idle heating based on presence patterns.",2,"Indicates absence with idle heating; low identity risk."
Adaptive preheating based on historical presence–temperature correlation,Use historical combinations of proximity timing and chosen temperatures to predict when and to what temperature to preheat the system so that water is near the desired level as soon as users next approach.,4,"Learns routine timing and target temps to anticipate presence."
User discomfort detection via proximity interruptions,"Frequent break-and-return patterns in proximity aligned with periods of temperature instability suggest users are stepping away and back due to discomfort, prompting system-side improvements in thermal control.",3,"Shows reactions to discomfort and movement timing."
Usage context inference (shower vs sink) from presence and temperature,"Long, continuous proximity with sustained warm temperatures likely corresponds to showers, while short, intermittent presence with modest temperatures suggests sink-based tasks.",4,"Infers activity type (shower vs sink) from patterns."
Heat-loss characterization after user departure,"After proximity ceases, analyze how quickly temperature drops to baseline; comparing this across fixtures gives insight into local insulation quality and whether fixtures retain heat after users leave.",2,"Departure timing plus cooldown; low behavioral exposure."
Detection of manual vs automated temperature setting,"Identify whether temperature shifts during proximity are smooth and continuous (manual adjustment) or step-like and repeatable (preset or automated control), distinguishing how users interact with temperature controls.",2,"Shows control method preference with modest identity risk."
Presence-triggered maximum temperature enforcement,"When proximity indicates a user is present and temperature rises toward a threshold, the system can enforce dynamic limits tailored to presence patterns (e.g., stricter limits when presence suggests children vs adults).",3,"Uses presence context to enforce limits, exposing who/when."
