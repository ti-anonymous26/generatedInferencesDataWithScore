inference,Description,score,short rationale
Differentiate intentional use from accidental trigger,"Compare proximity activation events with resulting flow patterns; activations followed by significant, sustained flow indicate intentional use, while activations with near-zero or extremely brief flow suggest accidental walk-bys or false triggers.",2,"Shows whether presence led to deliberate use, limited routine detail."
Latency between detection and water start,Measure the time gap between proximity activation timestamps and the first non-zero flow in the history to quantify system response time and identify fixtures that feel sluggish to users.,1,"System responsiveness metric with negligible personal exposure."
Sensitivity tuning for proximity sensors,"High counts of proximity activations that do not lead to meaningful flow show over-sensitivity, whereas flow starting without corresponding proximity events suggests under-sensitivity or misalignment of the sensor.",1,"Calibration insight, minimal behavioral data."
Hands-free usage ratio,"Identify sessions where flow starts and stops closely aligned with proximity activations, indicating predominantly sensor-driven, hands-free control, as opposed to sessions where flow behavior diverges from activation patterns.",2,"Reveals control style preferences with low identity risk."
Pet or child-triggered events,"Short, repeated proximity activations paired with small or intermittent flow bursts can indicate non-typical users such as pets or children triggering the faucet unintentionally, which might warrant sensitivity or angle adjustments.",3,"Infers household composition (children/pets) and usage incidents."
Presence without water usage,"Detect periods where proximity data shows sustained presence but flow remains at zero or near-zero, indicating users are near the fixture for non-water tasks (e.g., grooming near a sink) or are being cautious about unnecessary flow.",3,"Shows presence and behavior near fixture without flow."
Water left running after user departure,"Identify intervals where proximity data shows the user has left (no activation or presence) but flow continues, signaling that water is being left running intentionally or due to malfunctioning shutoff logic.",3,"Indicates negligence and timing of departure."
User approach behavior before activation,"Analyze the sequence and timing of proximity activations leading up to an increase in flow to understand how long users stand near the fixture before water is turned on, which may indicate hesitation or difficulty triggering the sensor.",2,"Captures hesitation/approach pattern, mild routine signal."
Multi-user or crowding detection around fixture,Clusters of overlapping or high-frequency proximity activations combined with alternating flow bursts can indicate multiple people taking turns or crowding around the same smart faucet or shower area.,4,"Reveals co-occupancy and shared-use periods."
Unnecessary re-triggering behavior,Sequences of proximity activations during a period of already-running flow may show that users repeatedly move in and out of the detection zone causing needless re-triggers or that the detection zone is poorly aligned with user movement.,2,"Shows movement patterns around fixture with low identifiability."
Detection of blocked or obstructed sensors,Continuous proximity activation with little or no corresponding flow change over time can indicate that an object (like a towel or cleaning cloth) is blocking the sensor field and keeping it constantly triggered.,1,"Indicates obstruction rather than user behavior."
Optimization of detection distance and angle,"By correlating the presence patterns (e.g., partial activations or intermittent detection) with flow start/stop behavior, the system can infer whether the detection zone is too narrow or too broad and recommend or apply configuration changes.",1,"Configuration tuning with minimal personal context."
Auto-shutoff timing validation,Compare the time when proximity events cease with when the flow rate actually drops to zero to validate whether the automatic shutoff closely tracks user departure or should be shortened or lengthened.,2,"Aligns flow stop to departure timing, modest exposure of exit times."
Idle flow detection during sustained presence,"Identify stretches where the user is continuously detected by proximity sensors but the flow is zero for long periods, indicating behavior like turning off water while lathering, which is a positive conservation habit.",2,"Shows conservation behavior during presence, limited identity."
Behavioral patterns for sensor-only vs manual control users,"Users whose flow on/off transitions almost always coincide with proximity changes behave differently from those whose flow changes occur with minimal proximity variation, allowing differentiation between sensor-reliant and manual-override users.",3,"Distinguishes control preferences, profiling usage style."
Distinguishing cleaning cycles from normal use,Cleaning often involves repeated proximity activations and short flow bursts; combined patterns of frequent on/off flow with closely spaced proximity events can be used to infer cleaning sessions without explicit labels.,3,"Identifies cleaning sessions and timing."
False-negative detection (flow without proximity),"When flow history shows clear water use but there is no corresponding proximity activation, this points to false negatives—cases where the sensor failed to detect presence or where water was turned on by another control path.",2,"Shows presence without detection, modest occupancy signal."
Security or unauthorized usage cues,"Unexpected proximity activations at odd hours combined with flow events may indicate unauthorized use of fixtures in public or semi-public spaces, triggering alerts or logging for facility managers.",4,"Exposes odd-hour presence, high profiling/security risk."
User learning curve with new sensors,"Shortly after installation or configuration changes, you may see many proximity activations with inconsistent flow responses; over time, the correlation between proximity and flow becomes smoother as users learn how to position their hands or bodies.",2,"Shows adaptation period but limited personal detail."
Touchless hygiene compliance analysis,"In environments where touchless operation is preferred (e.g., hospitals), a high proportion of flow events synchronized with proximity activations suggests that users are following the intended touchless hygiene protocols.",3,"Indicates adherence to hygiene protocols, profiling compliance."
Environmental interference detection,"Repeated proximity activations with no associated flow, especially in specific time windows, can reveal interference from environmental factors such as reflections, moving curtains, or sunlight that falsely trigger the sensor.",1,"Attributes noise to environment, minimal personal info."
Differentiation of quick rinses vs full use,"Short single proximity activations that produce a brief flow spike can be classified as quick rinses, whereas longer or multiple activations with more sustained flow indicate more intensive uses like handwashing or showering.",2,"Identifies task intensity with limited identity risk."
Optimal placement of proximity sensors in multi-fixture layouts,"By mapping how often proximity activations coincide with actual flow in a specific fixture relative to nearby fixtures, the system can infer whether sensors are triggering the correct fixture or if crosstalk between fixtures is occurring.",2,"Shows fixture preference patterns, coarse location use."
Detection of sensor dead zones,"Flow events that start only after users manually override or move significantly, combined with sparse proximity activations, indicate that certain approach paths are not well covered by the sensor's detection field.",2,"Reveals approach paths and movement, modest exposure."
Time-to-deactivation drift analysis,"Track how the time difference between the last proximity detection and actual flow stop evolves over months; increasing drift suggests hardware wear, firmware bugs, or calibration issues in auto-shutoff logic.",1,"Hardware drift metric with negligible behavioral data."
User preference for intermittent vs continuous flow,"Compare the pattern of proximity activations and flow bursts within a session to distinguish users who trigger short bursts (on when needed, off when not) vs users who stay within the detection zone and maintain continuous flow.",2,"Profiles flow-style preference with low re-identification."
Energy and water savings from sensor logic,Estimate savings by comparing hypothetical scenarios where flow would have continued during all proximity-detected presence with actual flow patterns; the gap represents water avoided by smart shutoff between proximity activations.,1,"Aggregated savings estimate, not person-specific."
Detection of stuck-on valves controlled by proximity systems,"If flow continues at a significant rate despite multiple proximity activations indicating exit and re-entry without expected changes in flow, it may signal that a valve or relay controlled by the sensor is stuck open.",1,"Mechanical fault indication with minimal personal context."
Pattern-based tuning for different environments,Different locations (public restroom vs private home) show distinct proximity-flow correlations; analyzing these patterns together allows environment-specific tuning of detection sensitivity and shutoff delays.,1,"Environment-level tuning, no individual exposure."
