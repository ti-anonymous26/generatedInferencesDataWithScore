Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Persistent low moisture indicates inadequate irrigation cadence,"If moisture readings consistently remain below typical thresholds without recovery spikes, it suggests the existing irrigation schedule does not replenish soil water adequately.",2,Under-watering pattern; minor operational detail.
Sharp moisture drops signal rapid soil drainage or high-permeability soil,"Sudden declines immediately after watering imply the soil cannot retain moisture well, pointing toward sandy or highly porous composition.",1,Soil permeability insight; minimal privacy.
Gradual moisture decline reflects slow evaporation and good water retention,"A smooth, extended drying curve indicates clay-rich or organic soils with stronger water-holding capacity.",1,Retention insight; minimal privacy.
Frequent oscillations between wet and dry states imply over-watering cycles,"If moisture repeatedly spikes to saturation and then drops rapidly and frequently, irrigation is happening more often than soil can balance naturally.",2,Over-watering pattern; low privacy risk.
Moisture plateauing at high levels indicates potential waterlogging,Readings that remain near saturation for prolonged periods despite pauses in watering may indicate poor drainage or soil compaction.,2,Waterlogging/compaction signal; low privacy risk.
A rising baseline over days suggests cumulative over-irrigation,"If the lowest daily moisture value trends upward, the soil is retaining excess water over time, signaling oversaturation risk.",2,Cumulative over-watering; minor operational detail.
A falling baseline over days indicates cumulative under-irrigation,Progressively lower troughs in moisture cycles show that irrigation is not compensating for water loss.,2,Cumulative under-watering; minor operational detail.
Delayed moisture increase after irrigation signals sensor depth-soil mismatch,"If irrigation occurs but moisture rises noticeably late, the sensor may be placed deeper than where water initially infiltrates.",2,Depth mismatch; minor operational insight.
Rapid moisture spikes reveal shallow infiltration or surface runoff,A fast jump followed by a quick decline means water saturates the top layer but does not penetrate deeper soil.,2,Runoff/shallow infiltration; low privacy risk.
Mid-range moisture stability suggests balanced irrigation performance,"If readings remain within a stable and moderate range, irrigation cycles are maintaining optimal soil hydration.",1,Balanced hydration; minimal privacy sensitivity.
Irregular moisture fluctuations indicate sensor calibration or placement issues,"Unpatterned spikes or drops without irrigation events imply sensor drift, loose installation, or electrical interference.",2,Potential sensor issue; minor operational detail.
Moisture recovery lag shows slower water absorption due to compacted soil,"If the soil takes unusually long to reach expected moisture levels, water is having difficulty infiltrating.",2,Compaction slowing absorption; low privacy risk.
Quick drying after peak moisture suggests high evapotranspiration potential,"Steep declines—without considering weather—indicate the soil itself has low retention capacity, allowing rapid moisture loss.",1,Low retention/evap stress; minimal privacy.
Moisture asymmetry between irrigation cycles signals uneven distribution,"If successive cycles show inconsistent moisture peaks, parts of the soil bed may be receiving different coverage.",2,Uneven coverage insight; minor operational detail.
Prolonged dryness followed by extreme spikes indicates episodic irrigation patterns,Large jumps after long dry periods show rare but heavy watering events.,2,Episodic heavy watering pattern; low privacy risk.
Persistent near-zero moisture readings indicate irrigation failure or blocked lines,"If the soil never registers hydration changes, water delivery may be disrupted entirely.",3,Sustained delivery failure; notable operational issue.
Moisture overshoot followed by extended high levels suggests excessive watering duration,"If the peak moisture exceeds typical saturation and stays elevated, watering sessions may be unnecessarily long.",2,Excessive duration; low privacy risk.
Low variability in readings implies stable environmental conditions or consistent irrigation,Minimal rise-and-fall cycles show that soil moisture is being held constant—intentionally or naturally.,1,Stable moisture; minimal privacy.
High variability implies unstable hydration dynamics,"Large, frequent deviations reveal inconsistent watering or highly reactive soil.",2,Unstable hydration pattern; low privacy risk.
Cyclic moisture patterns reveal habitual watering rhythms,"Regular peaks and troughs allow inference of underlying irrigation periodicity, even without schedule metadata.",2,Infers watering schedule; minor behavioral signal.
Moisture saturation without drying phases suggests continuous water presence,"If moisture remains at the sensor's maximum range, water may be pooling or the sensor could be submerged.",2,Continuous saturation; minor operational detail.
Flatline constant readings may indicate sensor malfunction,"When readings never change—wet or dry—the sensor may be disconnected, damaged, or incorrectly calibrated.",2,Sensor malfunction; minor operational detail.
Extremely slow drying rates point toward shaded or cool soil micro-conditions,"Even without temperature data, near-static moisture declines suggest low evaporation potential inherent to the soil zone.",1,Shaded/cool microclimate; minimal privacy.
Unexpected moisture spikes imply untracked water introduction,Sudden increases not aligned with expected irrigation patterns may indicate manual watering or leaks.,3,Unscheduled/manual water or leak; potential behavioral signal.
Repeated low-depth moisture despite irrigation implies deep infiltration beyond sensor reach,"If irrigation occurs but readings stay dry, water may be bypassing the sensor depth entirely.",2,Water bypassing sensor depth; low privacy risk.
Moisture gradient trends (upward or downward) reveal long-term soil health shifts,"Over weeks or months, upward trends suggest improved organic content or compaction; downward trends indicate degradation or increased porosity.",1,Soil health trend; minimal privacy.
