Water usage dropping sharply during rain detections indicates effective rain-based irrigation suppression,"When rain is detected and water usage per cycle decreases immediately, the system is successfully conserving water during rainfall.",2,Shows prompt rain-based shutoff; operational efficiency with low privacy risk.
Water usage remaining high during rain detections suggests irrigation override or misconfiguration,"If the system continues watering despite rain, rainfall suppression logic may be disabled or malfunctioning.",3,Reveals override/misconfig behavior despite rain; operational exposure.
Water usage dropping only slightly during rain detections indicates conservative or minimal rain-based adjustments,"The system may reduce irrigation modestly, assuming rainfall only partially meets watering needs.",2,Partial adjustment behavior; mild operational signal.
Water usage dropping to zero during rain detections indicates complete reliance on rainfall,"The system fully shuts off irrigation when rainfall occurs, maximizing water conservation.",2,Full shutoff during rain; operational logic with limited privacy impact.
Rain detections followed by delayed water usage reduction suggest buffering logic or verification thresholds,Irrigation may stop only after rainfall persists long enough to satisfy system criteria.,2,Delay exposes threshold/buffering settings; mild operational detail.
Water usage increasing during long gaps between rain detections indicates dry periods requiring more irrigation,The absence of rainfall forces the system to compensate with higher irrigation volumes.,2,Dry-gap compensation; operational trend only.

Water usage spikes immediately after rain detection gaps indicate recovery watering,"Following rainfall-free periods, the system increases irrigation to replenish soil moisture.",2,Post-gap replenishment behavior; operational pattern.
Frequent rain detections paired with consistently low water usage indicate rain-dominant climate periods,"Natural rainfall regularly replaces irrigation needs, keeping water usage minimal.",2,Rain replaces irrigation; climate-driven low demand.
Frequent rain detections paired with high water usage indicate insufficient rainfall intensity,"The rain sensor detects rain often, but rainfall is too weak to reduce irrigation demand.",2,Rain too weak to offset irrigation; operational threshold clue.
Water usage plateauing at low levels during sustained rain detection clusters indicates extended wet-season behavior,Continuous rain keeps water usage consistently low across cycles.,2,Wet-season low demand; operational/climate context.

Water usage variability increasing during mixed rain detection periods suggests inconsistent rainfall intensity,Fluctuating rain strength results in alternating irrigation adjustments.,2,Usage variability tracks inconsistent rain; operational context.
Water usage spikes occurring only when rain detections stop indicate rapid environmental drying,"After rain ends, evaporation may increase quickly, requiring more irrigation.",2,Post-rain drying triggers higher use; operational behavior.

Lack of water usage reduction during long rain detection streaks indicates threshold-based logic requiring higher rainfall intensity,The system may only reduce irrigation when rainfall exceeds a certain threshold.,3,Non-reduction despite rain discloses threshold/logic settings.
Significant water usage reduction during minor rain detections suggests overly sensitive rainfall thresholds,Even light rain leads to noticeable irrigation suppression.,3,Oversensitive thresholds revealed; operational configuration exposure.
Water usage profiles mirroring rain detection timing indicate strong integration between rainfall events and irrigation,"Usage drops and rises closely follow rain patterns, showing tight coupling.",2,Tight coupling to rain timing; mild operational exposure.
Water usage profiles diverging from rain detection timing indicate additional irrigation drivers,"Soil moisture, schedules, or manual controls may override rain-based decisions.",3,Divergence reveals other controls/overrides; operational behavior exposure.
Water usage dropping across all zones during rain detections suggests uniform rainfall distribution,"Rainfall affects the entire irrigation area equally, reducing watering everywhere.",2,Uniform zone response; low-risk site context.
Water usage dropping only in certain zones during rain detections indicates localized rainfall,"Some areas receive rain while others remain dry, requiring zone-specific irrigation.",2,Zone-specific rain effect; minor site profiling.
Water usage increasing across all zones after multi-day periods with no rain detections indicates system-wide compensation for drought conditions,The entire property requires more irrigation due to prolonged dryness.,2,System-wide compensation; operational trend.
Water usage decreasing across all zones after strong rainfall periods indicates widespread soil saturation,"Rainfall saturates soil uniformly, reducing watering needs everywhere.",2,Uniform saturation reduces use; operational/climate context.
Water usage failing to change during rain detection events suggests irrigation logic operates independently of rainfall,The system may rely solely on schedules or soil moisture and ignore rain detection signals.,3,Independence from rain reveals control design/override; operational exposure.
Water usage declining slowly during periodic rain detections indicates intermittent rainfall insufficient for rapid soil hydration,The system gradually reduces irrigation as rainfall accumulates over time.,2,Slow decline with intermittent rain; operational trend only.
Water usage increasing sharply after rain detections cease indicates rehydration need following shallow or ineffective rainfall,"Rainfall did not penetrate deeply enough, requiring supplementary irrigation.",2,Rehydration after light rain; operational pattern.
Water usage stabilizing at a moderate level during alternating rain/no-rain detections indicates balanced irrigation adjustment,The system modulates irrigation to accommodate inconsistent rainfall patterns.,2,Balanced adjustment; low privacy risk.
