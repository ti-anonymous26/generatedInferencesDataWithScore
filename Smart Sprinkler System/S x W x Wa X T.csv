Inference,Description,score,short rationale
High water usage with weather‑based irrigation increases and falling soil moisture during high temperatures indicates extreme evaporative stress,Even increased irrigation cannot counter rapid moisture loss driven by heat and dry air.,3,"Severe drying despite higher irrigation."
"Soil moisture rising during weather-based reductions, low water usage, and high humidity indicates naturally moist atmospheric conditions","Environmental moisture offsets reduced irrigation, allowing soil moisture to increase.",1,"Natural atmospheric moisture raising soil; minimal sensitivity."
"Stable soil moisture during fluctuating water usage, temperature swings, and weather adjustments indicates strong soil buffering capacity",The soil can retain moisture despite external variability.,1,"Buffered soil behavior; very low sensitivity."
"Soil moisture dropping during high water usage, weather-based irrigation increases, high temperatures, and low humidity indicates maximum environmental drying",The combination of heat and dryness overwhelms irrigation capacity.,3,"Maximum drying overpowering irrigation."
"Soil moisture rising during low water usage, weather-based reductions, cool temperatures, and high humidity indicates ideal natural moisture retention",Low evaporative loss supports soil hydration even with minimal irrigation.,1,"Ideal natural retention; minimal sensitivity."
"Water usage rising despite weather-based reductions, falling soil moisture, and high temperatures indicates under-irrigation during heat stress",The system reduces watering even though conditions require more irrigation.,3,"Under-watering in heat despite reduction commands."
"Water usage staying low during weather-based increases, rising soil moisture, cool temperatures, and high humidity suggests efficient environmental hydration","Cool, moist conditions maintain hydration without requiring much irrigation.",1,"Environmental hydration suffices; very low sensitivity."
"Soil moisture dropping when weather-based increases occur, water usage rises modestly, and temperature is high indicates irrigation limitations",The system attempts to compensate but cannot deliver sufficient water.,3,"Capacity/coverage limits under heat."
"Soil moisture rising strongly when weather-based increases occur, water usage spikes, and temperature is moderate indicates efficient irrigation absorption",Moisture responds well to irrigation under favorable temperatures.,1,"Efficient absorption under moderate temps; minimal sensitivity."
"Soil moisture falling during weather-based increases, rising water usage, low humidity, and moderate temperatures indicates soil structural issues",Water may not infiltrate due to compaction or hydrophobicity.,3,"Structural soil issues despite higher watering."
"Weather-based increases with rising water usage, rising soil moisture, and low humidity indicate correct atmospheric-drying compensation",Dry air triggers irrigation and the soil responds accordingly.,1,"Correct compensation for dry air; very low sensitivity."
"Weather-based reductions with falling water usage, stable soil moisture, cool temperatures, and rising humidity indicate optimal conservation behavior",Environmental conditions lower irrigation demand without harming soil moisture.,1,"Optimal conservation in humid cool conditions."
"Water usage rising while weather-based reductions occur, soil moisture falling, and temperature rising suggests conflicting irrigation signals",The system reduces irrigation but actual demand increases due to heat.,3,"Conflicting signals causing under-watering in heat."
"Water usage dropping while weather-based increases occur, soil moisture stable, and humidity rising indicates moisture from external sources",Humidity or dew is contributing enough to justify irrigation reduction despite system requests.,2,"External moisture offsets need despite increase commands."
"Soil moisture sharply rising when temperature drops, humidity rises, weather-based reductions occur, and water usage falls indicates rainfall or dew contribution",External moisture fully compensates for reduced irrigation.,1,"Rain/dew fully replacing irrigation; minimal sensitivity."
"Soil moisture stable across high temperature, fluctuating humidity, rising water usage, and weather-based increases indicates deep soil buffering",Irrigation and environmental changes do not immediately affect moisture at sensor depth.,2,"Deep buffering/lag; low privacy risk."
"Soil moisture declining despite cool temperatures, high humidity, increasing water usage, and weather-based increases indicates deep drought conditions",Moisture deficit is so severe that conditions cannot reverse soil drying.,3,"Deep drought despite heavy watering."
"Soil moisture rising despite high temperatures, low humidity, and weather-based reductions with low water usage indicates heavy dew or mist events",Natural atmospheric moisture offsets high evaporative stress unexpectedly.,2,"Unexpected atmospheric moisture under harsh conditions."
"Weather-based reductions occurring with rising temperature, rising water usage, and falling soil moisture indicate incorrect dryness prediction",The system reduces irrigation when dryness conditions require higher watering.,3,"Misjudged dryness leading to reductions."
"Weather-based increases with decreasing temperature, rising humidity, and rising soil moisture indicate stale or forecast-dependent logic",The system calls for more irrigation even though conditions naturally increase soil moisture.,3,"Stale/forecast logic boosting use despite moist conditions."
