Water usage dropping sharply during rain detections and weather-based irrigation reductions indicates strong rainfall replacement,The system correctly reduces irrigation when rainfall events occur and watering is no longer needed.,1,"Rain replaces irrigation; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage remaining high during rain detections despite weather-based reductions indicates misalignment or delayed irrigation shutdown,"The system detects rain but continues watering, suggesting override settings or slow response.",3,"Highlights misaligned shutdown despite rain."
Water usage rising during long rain-detection gaps while weather logs show irrigation increases indicates drought-recovery irrigation behavior,Extended dry periods trigger both automatic irrigation boosts and higher water usage.,2,"Dry-gap compensation; low privacy risk."
Water usage falling during long rain-detection gaps while weather logs show reductions indicates forecast-based water conservation,"The system may expect rain and reduce irrigation even before rainfall occurs, conserving water.",2,"Forecast-based cutbacks; modest operational exposure."
Water usage remaining low during frequent rain detections and weather-based reductions indicates wet-season irrigation suppression,Both rainfall events and system logic continually minimize irrigation in wet conditions.,1,"Wet-season suppression; very low sensitivity."
Water usage rising despite frequent rain detections and weather-based reductions suggests insufficient rainfall intensity,"Rain signals occur, but rainfall volume is too low to reduce irrigation needs.",2,"Insufficient rain prompting use; low sensitivity."
Water usage falling to near-zero during repeated rain detections and weather-based reductions indicates exclusive rainfall hydration,"Natural rainfall provides all required moisture, eliminating irrigation demand.",1,"Rain-only hydration; minimal sensitivity."
Weather-based increases with high water usage during long dry periods with no rain detections indicate strong environmental drying conditions,The system compensates aggressively for extended rainfall absence.,2,"Aggressive compensation during dryness; low privacy impact."
Weather-based reductions with low water usage during rain detections indicate effective real-time rainfall adaptation,Rainfall instantly reduces irrigation activity and water output.,1,"Effective rain adaptation; very low sensitivity."
Weather-based irrigation increases during rain gaps with stable low water usage indicates configuration limiting irrigation scaling,"The system requests more irrigation, but output remains capped or restricted.",3,"Potential cap/limitation despite increase commands."
Weather-based irrigation reductions without rain detections but with decreasing water usage indicate humidity-driven or cloud-cover–driven adjustments,The system reduces irrigation even in the absence of rain due to environmental moisture cues.,2,"Non-rain moisture cues reducing use; low sensitivity."
Water usage rising before rain detections while weather logs show increases may indicate forecast-driven pre-watering,The system boosts irrigation in anticipation of dryness before rainfall begins.,2,"Pre-watering ahead of expected rain; modest operational detail."
Water usage dropping before rain detections while weather logs show reductions indicates forecast-driven irrigation minimization,Irrigation is reduced because expected rainfall is predicted soon.,2,"Pre-rain minimization; low sensitivity."
Weather-based reductions with stable water usage during rain detections indicate irrigation system timing delays,The system has recognized rainfall but the physical irrigation cycle has not yet shut off fully.,3,"Delay between logic and actual shutoff."
Weather-based increases with rising water usage during periods of intermittent rain detections indicate rainfall insufficient to maintain soil moisture,Frequent but weak rainfall fails to prevent irrigation demand increases.,2,"Weak/intermittent rain prompting irrigation; low sensitivity."
Water usage falling gradually after rain detections even without additional weather-based reductions indicates soil saturation effects,Rainfall increases soil moisture enough to naturally lower irrigation need.,1,"Saturation lowering use; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage stabilizing at a low level during alternating rain detections and weather reductions suggests a balanced mixed-wet climatic period,Frequent wet conditions keep irrigation volume consistently low.,1,"Mixed-wet period keeps usage low; very low sensitivity."
"Water usage fluctuating strongly during alternating rain detections and weather increases suggests unstable, intermittent storm patterns",Irrigation has to adapt continuously to unpredictable rainfall behavior.,2,"Unstable storms forcing frequent adjustment; low sensitivity."
Water usage rising sharply after multiple rain detections when weather logs show increases indicates rapid post-rain evaporation or soil drying,"Moisture from rainfall dissipates quickly, forcing irrigation to scale upward.",3,"Post-rain drying drives high use; moderate concern."
Water usage dropping sharply after multiple rain detections when weather logs show reductions indicates cumulative rainfall saturation,"Soil stays moist long after rain events, reducing irrigation demand.",1,"Cumulative saturation reduces need; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage rising despite weather-based reductions and absence of rain detections indicates predictive logic failing to match actual dryness,"The system expects sufficient moisture, but conditions remain dry.",3,"Forecast mismatch leading to dryness."
Water usage falling despite weather-based increases and absence of rain detections suggests user intervention or system override,Manual settings or hardware limitations prevent irrigation scaling.,3,"User/override or failure blocking commanded increases."
Weather-based irrigation increases with rapidly rising water usage during extended rain-detection gaps indicate early-stage drought formation,Rainfall absence forces irrigation demand up before critical dryness.,2,"Early drought compensation; low privacy risk."
Weather-based irrigation reductions with rapidly falling water usage during consecutive rain detections indicate high-intensity rain events,Heavy rainfall makes irrigation unnecessary across cycles.,1,"High-intensity rain suppresses use; very low sensitivity."
Stable water usage during volatile weather logs and inconsistent rain detections indicates irrigation insensitivity to environmental variation,System may be configured with fixed watering schedules.,2,"Insensitivity due to fixed scheduling; low privacy risk."
Water usage rising during nighttime rain detections when weather logs show increases indicates mistimed irrigation schedules,Irrigation cycles overlap with rainfall during times when watering should be minimized.,3,"Mistimed night watering despite rain."
Water usage dropping during nighttime rain detections when weather logs show reductions indicates ideal irrigation suppression,The system avoids unnecessary watering during rain and low-evaporation nighttime conditions.,1,"Correct night suppression; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage rising during high-temperature rain detections while weather logs increase indicates warm-season storm incompetence,Rainfall fails to lower irrigation demand due to heat-driven moisture loss.,2,"Heat overrides storm moisture; low sensitivity."
Water usage falling during low-temperature rain detections while weather logs reduce indicates efficient cold-season water saving,"Cool rain events allow deep moisture retention, reducing irrigation requirement.",1,"Efficient cold-season saving; very low sensitivity."
