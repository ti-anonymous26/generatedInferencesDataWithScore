Inference,Description,score,short rationale
Soil moisture rising immediately after rain detections indicates effective rainfall absorption,"When rain events pause irrigation and soil moisture increases at the same time, the soil is efficiently capturing rainwater.",1,Environmental moisture response only; no person-level detail.
Soil moisture remaining unchanged after rain detections suggests light rainfall or poor infiltration,"If moisture levels do not rise following rain-triggered pauses, rainfall may be too weak or soil infiltration may be limited.",1,"Shows weak rain/infiltration; site trait, minimal privacy exposure."
Soil moisture declining despite frequent rain detections indicates insufficient rainfall intensity,Multiple rain events that fail to lift moisture suggest drizzle or minimal precipitation.,1,Weather intensity insight only; no behavioral signal.
Large soil moisture spikes following rain detections indicate heavy rainfall events,"If moisture jumps sharply after rain pauses, rainfall was strong enough to saturate the soil quickly.",1,Strong rainfall indicator only; no user or identity link.
Soil moisture increasing more during rain-triggered pauses than during irrigation cycles indicates rain is more effective than irrigation,Rainwater may penetrate deeper or spread more evenly than artificial watering.,2,Compares rain vs irrigation effectiveness; mild operational insight.
Soil moisture saturation occurring repeatedly during periods with many rain detections indicates prolonged wet spells,"Moisture reaches near-maximum levels each time rainfall occurs, suggesting continuous or intense rainy conditions.",1,Extended wet-climate signal; no personal behavior implied.
Infrequent rain detections paired with slow soil moisture decline indicate high soil water retention,"Even with few rain events, moisture decreases gradually, meaning the soil holds water well.",1,"Soil retention trait; environmental, not personal."
Infrequent rain detections paired with rapid soil moisture decline indicate poor soil retention or high evapotranspiration,"Soil dries quickly when rainfall is rare, signaling environmental or soil-based drying pressures.",1,Drying tendency only; minimal privacy relevance.
Soil moisture rising before the recorded rain detection indicates early rainfall onset or sensor delay,"Moisture may respond faster than the rain detection signal, suggesting sensor timing offsets.",2,Reveals timing misalignment/sensor lag; mild operational detail.
Soil moisture rising *after* a significant delay from the rain detection suggests slow percolation,"The soil may take longer to absorb rainfall, especially if the surface layer is compacted or hydrophobic.",2,Highlights soil permeability characteristics; weak privacy risk.
Soil moisture dropping quickly after rain-driven increases indicates fast-draining or sandy soil,High percolation removes water rapidly after rainfall events.,1,Soil type inference only; no behavioral exposure.
Soil moisture staying elevated long after rain detections indicates clayey or poorly drained soil,Moisture lingers because water cannot drain efficiently.,1,Drainage trait insight; minimal privacy impact.
Low soil moisture during long gaps between rain detections indicates drought stress,Extended periods without rainfall correlate with soil moisture depletion.,1,Drought signal only; no person-level data.
Soil moisture remaining stable during long gaps between rain detections suggests vegetation or shading reduces water loss,"Moisture does not fall significantly despite dry weather, indicating low evapotranspiration.",2,Suggests site vegetation/shade patterns; mild context exposure.
High frequency of rain detections paired with constantly low soil moisture indicates rainfall not reaching the root zone,"Rain may be blocked by canopy cover, evaporating quickly, or insufficient in volume to penetrate deeply.",2,Implies canopy/coverage blocking rain; reveals site layout lightly.
High frequency of rain detections paired with stable high soil moisture indicates rainfall dominance in hydration,Natural rain alone maintains moisture without requiring irrigation.,1,Rain-dominant hydration insight; no behavioral tie.

Very small soil moisture increases during heavy rain detection clustering indicate deep sensor placement,Rainfall affects surface layers strongly but has limited effect at deeper soil levels.,2,Discloses sensor installation depth; operational detail only.
Soil moisture decreasing during rain detection periods suggests sensor or hardware malfunction,Moisture should rise or stabilize during rain; declining values indicate anomalous behavior.,3,Indicates device fault/maintenance needs; operational behavior exposure.
Soil moisture increasing inconsistently across rain detections indicates variable rainfall intensity,Some rainfall events are strong enough to raise soil moisture while others are too weak.,1,Variability in weather only; negligible privacy risk.
Steady moisture increases across successive rain detections indicate cumulative rainfall saturation,"Each rainfall event builds on the previous one, steadily increasing soil water levels.",1,Cumulative weather effect; no personal signal.
Moisture increases that plateau even with multiple rain detections indicate soil saturation limits,"Once the soil reaches capacity, additional rainfall produces no further moisture rise.",1,Soil capacity insight; minimal privacy exposure.
Moisture failing to fully recover between rain detections indicates persistent environmental drying forces,Soil loses water faster than rainfall replenishes it.,1,Drying pressure cue only; no behavioral data.
Strong correlation between rain detections and moisture rise indicates high-quality sensor alignment,"Moisture readings and rainfall detection match consistently, showing reliable sensor feedback.",2,Reflects maintenance/calibration quality; mild operational signal.
Weak correlation between rain detections and moisture changes suggests calibration or placement issues,"Rainfall events do not produce expected moisture changes, implying sensor misalignment.",2,Shows sensor misplacement/calibration gap; limited privacy risk.
Soil moisture rising only during heavy rain detections suggests threshold-based rain contribution,"Light rain has little effect, but heavy rain increases moisture noticeably.",1,Rain threshold insight; no user linkage.
Moisture rising modestly during rain and sharply during irrigation indicates irrigation is more effective locally,The sprinkler delivers water more efficiently than rainfall to the monitored zone.,2,Compares irrigation vs rain performance; minor operational exposure.
Rain detections with identical soil moisture responses across zones indicate uniform rainfall distribution,All monitored locations show equal moisture behavior following rain.,1,Uniform weather effect; no personal detail.
Rain detections with varied soil moisture responses indicate microclimatic rainfall variation,Some areas receive heavier rainfall than others.,2,Reveals zone-level differences; slight site profiling.
Rain detection clusters followed by decreasing soil moisture suggest intermittent rainfall insufficient for deep recharge,Rain falls frequently but too lightly to replenish deeper soil layers.,1,Intermittent weather effect only; negligible privacy risk.
Periods with no rain detections but increasing soil moisture indicate unlogged rainfall or irrigation drift,"Moisture rises without rain logs, implying rainfall was missed or water drifted from adjacent zones.",3,"Shows unlogged watering/rain events, exposing operational gaps/possible off-cycle watering."
Periods with rain detections but decreasing moisture indicate evaporation beating rainfall,Insufficient rainfall cannot counter ongoing moisture loss.,1,Environmental evaporation signal; no behavioral link.
Soil moisture spikes occurring only during rain detections and not during irrigation indicate possible sprinkler malfunction,"If irrigation cycles fail to change moisture while rain does, irrigation delivery is impaired.",3,Implies irrigation failure and maintenance needs; operational behavior exposure.
