Inconsistent volumes within the same day indicate dynamic intra-day irrigation needs,Multiple cycles with differing volumes show fluctuating demand across the day.,3,Intra-day variability exposes responsive watering behavior.

Anomalously large cycles may signal leak-compensation behavior,Very large cycle volumes may indicate water loss being offset by the system.,3,Potential leak-response behavior exposes maintenance/operational state.
Anomalously small cycles could indicate clogging or restricted flow,Abnormally low usage suggests poor water delivery or blockages.,3,Suggests clogging/restricted delivery; maintenance/operational exposure.
