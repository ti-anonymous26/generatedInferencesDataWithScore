Inference,Description,score,short rationale
"Soil moisture rising during rain detections, weather-based irrigation reductions, and low water usage indicates strong rainfall replacement","Natural rainfall fully compensates for reduced irrigation, allowing soil moisture to increase without added water.",1,"Rain replaces irrigation; minimal sensitivity."
"Soil moisture falling during rain detections, weather-based reductions, and low water usage indicates rainfall too weak to offset moisture loss","The system correctly reduces irrigation for rain, but rainfall is insufficient to maintain soil water levels.",2,"Weak rain after reductions; low privacy impact."
Soil moisture rising when weather-based increases and high water usage occur during no-rain periods indicates effective irrigation under dry conditions,The system responds to dryness and irrigation successfully raises soil moisture.,2,"Irrigation effective in dry gaps; low sensitivity."
"Soil moisture falling despite weather-based increases, rising water usage, and no rain detections indicates extreme drought or poor infiltration",Even high irrigation cannot restore soil moisture due to harsh environmental or soil limitations.,3,"Severe drought/infiltration failure despite high inputs."
Soil moisture rising during rain detections even when weather-based increases and high water usage overlap indicates irrigation overriding rainfall impact,"The system waters despite rain, causing compounded soil moisture gains.",2,"Overlap rain + irrigation raising moisture; modest sensitivity."
"Soil moisture stable during rain detections, weather-based reductions, and zero water usage indicates moderate rainfall insufficient to hydrate soil deeply",Rain moistens the surface but does not penetrate far enough to affect sensor readings.,2,"Shallow rain with no irrigation; low privacy risk."
Water usage rising when weather-based increases and no rain detections occur while soil moisture falls indicates strong atmospheric drying,The system compensates for absent rainfall and ongoing moisture loss by increasing irrigation.,2,"Atmospheric drying driving usage; low sensitivity."
Water usage falling when weather-based reductions and rain detections coincide while soil moisture rises indicates optimal system behavior,Rainfall takes over hydration so irrigation decreases while soil moisture improves.,1,"Optimal rain-driven suppression; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage staying high during rain detections and weather reductions with soil moisture falling indicates irrigation system malfunction,"The system does not reduce watering correctly despite rain, and moisture still declines.",3,"Malfunction/override keeping high use in rain."
Soil moisture rising slowly during long rain detection periods despite weather reductions and low water usage indicates sustained light rainfall,Small but continuous rainfall gradually increases soil moisture.,1,"Light sustained rain raising moisture; very low sensitivity."
Soil moisture rising quickly during rain detections and low water usage with weather reductions indicates heavy storm activity,Strong rainfall rapidly hydrates soil without requiring irrigation.,1,"Heavy storm hydration; minimal sensitivity."
Soil moisture falling rapidly during no rain detections and stable water usage despite weather-based increases indicates inadequate irrigation capacity,The system attempts to increase watering but cannot keep up with moisture loss.,3,"Capacity shortfall under dryness."
Soil moisture stable while water usage fluctuates and rain detections occur intermittently indicates soil buffering and saturation equilibrium,The soil holds consistent moisture regardless of watering or rainfall variation.,1,"Buffered/saturated soil; very low sensitivity."
Water usage dropping sharply before rain detections and soil moisture rising indicates accurate forecast-based irrigation reductions,The system anticipates rainfall and reduces irrigation in advance.,1,"Accurate forecast reductions; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage rising before long dry periods with soil moisture falling and no rain detections indicates effective drought preparation,Irrigation increases early to counter upcoming dryness.,2,"Pre-drought irrigation increase; low privacy risk."
"Weather-based reductions with rising soil moisture, falling water usage, and multiple rain detections indicate ideal wet-season suppression","Rain events naturally hydrate soil, reducing the need for irrigation.",1,"Wet-season suppression; very low sensitivity."
"Weather-based increases with falling soil moisture, rising water usage, and long rain gaps indicate strong seasonal dryness",Absence of rainfall forces irrigation demand upward to counter soil moisture decline.,2,"Seasonal dryness response; low sensitivity."
"Soil moisture dropping despite rain detections, weather reductions, and stable water usage indicates rainfall not reaching root zone",Shallow rainfall or canopy effects prevent water from reaching deeper soil layers.,2,"Rain not reaching roots; modest operational detail."
Soil moisture rising during weather-based increases and high water usage despite no rain detections indicates irrigation-driven hydration phase,The system increases watering in dry periods and the soil moisture responds accordingly.,2,"Irrigation-driven gains in dry periods; low privacy risk."
"Water usage near-zero during rain detections, low temperatures, and weather reductions while soil moisture rises indicates optimal rainfall integration",The system avoids unnecessary irrigation as rainfall and cool conditions support soil hydration.,1,"Optimal integration of cool rain; minimal sensitivity."
