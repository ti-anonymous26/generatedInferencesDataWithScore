Inference,Description,score,short rationale
High water usage combined with weather-based irrigation increases and persistent low soil moisture indicates chronic under-irrigation or poor soil retention,"Even when weather signals dryness and irrigation volume increases, moisture remains low, suggesting water is not retained or delivered effectively.",3,"Flags persistent irrigation/soil failures under high inputs."
Water usage increases following weather-driven irrigation boosts that successfully raise soil moisture indicate efficient irrigation delivery during dry periods,"Weather recognizes dryness, increases irrigation, and soil moisture responds positively.",1,"Shows effective control; minimal sensitivity."
Weather-based irrigation reductions combined with stable soil moisture and low water usage imply rainfall is fully meeting hydration needs,Rain or moisture-rich conditions allow the system to reduce watering while keeping soil moisture stable.,1,"Indicates rain covering demand; very low sensitivity."
Weather-based irrigation reductions paired with falling soil moisture and low water usage indicate insufficient rainfall despite weather expectations,The system misinterprets weather signals or relies on forecasts that do not reflect actual rainfall.,2,"Reveals forecast/misread rain leading to under-watering."
Rising soil moisture during periods of reduced water usage and active weather-based reductions indicates successful natural rainfall contribution,"Soil moisture increases without irrigation, confirming rainfall effectiveness.",1,"Natural rain effect; minimal sensitivity."
Increasing weather-driven irrigation combined with steady water usage but dropping soil moisture indicates irrigation system delivery failure,"The system attempts to increase watering, but actual water volume remains unchanged, failing to correct dryness.",3,"Highlights delivery failure despite commands."
High water usage with minimal soil moisture increase and frequent weather-driven irrigation boosts suggest hydrophobic soil or surface runoff,"Even increased irrigation fails to raise moisture, indicating absorption problems.",3,"Shows absorption/runoff issues under high use."
Low water usage with decreasing soil moisture and no weather-based irrigation increases indicate missed dryness signals,"Weather system does not detect dryness, leading to insufficient irrigation.",2,"Missed dryness cues causing moisture decline."
High water usage with weather-based reductions and rising soil moisture indicate overlapping rainfall and irrigation saturation,"The system reduces watering during wet conditions, yet prior irrigation still contributes to rising moisture.",2,"Overlap of rain and irrigation; modest sensitivity."
Water usage falling to zero during weather-based reductions with rising soil moisture indicates rainfall is the exclusive water source,Soil moisture increases solely due to natural precipitation.,1,"Rain-only hydration; very low sensitivity."
Consistent soil moisture despite variable water usage and weather adjustments suggests highly buffered or well-structured soil,Environmental or irrigation fluctuations have minimal effect on moisture levels.,1,"Buffered soil behavior; minimal sensitivity."
Soil moisture dropping during high water usage and weather-driven increases indicates evapotranspiration overpowering irrigation,"Environmental drying forces exceed irrigation capacity, likely during heat waves.",3,"Severe drying beyond irrigation capacity."
Rapid soil moisture rise during weather-based irrigation increases but not during normal water cycles suggests event‑based irrigation effectiveness,"Large, targeted increases in watering affect moisture more than routine watering.",2,"Event-based boosts more effective than routine; low risk."
Weather-based reductions with constant water usage and rising soil moisture indicate supplemental rainfall not captured in irrigation logs,Moisture increases despite irrigation not decreasing fully; rainfall is filling the gap.,2,"Rain contribution unseen by logs; modest sensitivity."
Weather-based irrigation increases with no change in water usage but rising soil moisture indicates natural rainfall despite dryness forecasts,"The system wants to water more, but rainfall still raises moisture levels.",2,"Rainfall offsets forecast-driven irrigation demand."
Weather-based reductions accompanied by soil moisture decline and unchanged water usage indicate rainfall overestimation,"The system assumes it rained sufficiently, but soil moisture proves otherwise.",2,"Overestimated rain leading to moisture loss."
Weather-based increases followed by soil moisture drops and stable water usage indicate trigger logic without actual irrigation output,"Dry conditions raise irrigation demand, but the system fails to deliver more water.",3,"Commanded increases not delivered; operational failure."
Simultaneous spikes in water usage and soil moisture during weather-driven irrigation increases indicate strong system responsiveness,Irrigation aligns properly with weather cues and produces expected moisture results.,1,"Responsive control behaving as intended."
Soil moisture plateauing at high levels during low water usage and weather reductions indicates soil saturation,Irrigation remains low because the soil cannot take more water.,1,"Saturation state; very low sensitivity."
Soil moisture plateauing at low levels during high water usage and weather increases indicates irrigation inefficiency or severe dryness,"The system delivers more water, but moisture levels refuse to rise.",3,"Persistent low moisture despite high inputs."
Water usage trending downward while soil moisture remains stable and weather logs show reductions indicates optimal rainfall coverage,The system relies less on irrigation because rainfall meets hydration needs.,1,"Rain covering needs; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage trending upward while soil moisture remains stable and weather logs show increases indicates balanced dryness compensation,The system raises irrigation to maintain moisture at ideal levels.,1,"Balanced compensation; very low sensitivity."
Water usage rising and soil moisture rising despite weather-based reductions indicates late or weak rainfall synchronization,Reductions may occur prematurely or not reflect actual conditions.,2,"Reductions misaligned with actual wetness."
"Water usage falling but soil moisture falling too, even with weather reductions, indicates rainfall is insufficient to offset reduced irrigation","The system misjudged rainfall capacity, leading to moisture deficits.",2,"Under-watering due to optimistic rainfall assumption."
Large swings in water usage with stable soil moisture and variable weather logs indicate soil-depth buffering or irrigation reaching non-sensor zones,Moisture sensor location dampens visible effects of watering changes.,1,"Sensor/soil buffering masks changes; very low sensitivity."
Consistent high soil moisture despite minimal water usage and frequent weather reductions indicates rainy season saturation,Natural rainfall maintains optimal soil moisture.,1,"Rainy-season saturation; minimal sensitivity."
Dropping soil moisture despite rising water usage and weather-driven boosts indicates extreme drought conditions,Environmental demand exceeds both irrigation and rainfall compensation.,3,"Extreme drought overriding all inputs."
High water usage with no weather-based increases and rising soil moisture suggests schedule-based watering dominance,Irrigation changes are driven by fixed schedules rather than weather logic.,2,"Schedule-driven watering overshadowing weather controls."
Low water usage with strong weather-based increases and stable soil moisture indicates minimal irrigation needed to maintain hydration,"Weather suggests dryness, but soil remains sufficiently moist.",1,"Low irrigation need despite dry signals; very low sensitivity."
