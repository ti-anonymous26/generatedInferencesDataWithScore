Weather-based irrigation reductions that coincide exactly with rain detections indicate strong rainfall integration,"If irrigation is consistently reduced whenever rain is detected, the system properly uses rainfall signals to pause watering.",2,"Reductions align with rain; operational integration, low privacy risk."
Weather-based irrigation increases occurring during long gaps between rain detections indicate dry weather dominance,"When rain events are rare and weather logs show more irrigation boosts, the system responds to extended dry periods.",2,Dry gaps drive boosts; operational trend only.
Weather-based reductions occurring even during brief rain detections suggest conservative or highly sensitive rainfall response,"Even small rain events trigger irrigation pauses, showing the system prioritizes rainfall heavily.",2,"Sensitive rain response; operational logic exposure, low privacy impact."
Weather-based irrigation increases during periods with frequent rain detections indicate conflicting triggers or unregistered soil saturation,"If the system boosts watering despite rain detections, other dryness cues or logic layers may override rainfall inputs.",3,Boosts despite rain expose conflicting logic/overrides; operational behavior exposure.

Weather-driven irrigation increases during sparse rain detections reflect early onset of a dry season,"As rainfall declines, irrigation boosts become more common.",2,Boosts as rain declines; operational trend.
Weather-based irrigation reductions during rain detection gaps may imply lingering wetness from earlier rainfall,The system reduces watering even without new rain because residual conditions still warrant it.,2,Cuts during gaps show residual wetness assumption; low privacy risk.
Weather-based increases with no rain detections but with long dry intervals suggest the system tracks rainfall deficit,Absence of rain over time triggers irrigation boosts to compensate for cumulative dryness.,2,Long dry deficit triggers boosts; operational pattern only.
Weather-based reductions that occur across multiple zones simultaneously with rain detections show uniform storm coverage,All zones respond equally to widespread rainfall events.,2,Uniform cross-zone cuts; low-risk site context.
Weather-based increases occurring only in certain zones while rain detections are uniform indicate uneven weather–zone logic calibration,Some zones respond more strongly to dryness despite equal rain detection.,3,Zone-specific response despite uniform rain exposes calibration/logic differences.
Rain detections concentrated in short bursts causing immediate irrigation reductions indicate threshold-based rainfall logic,Sensors trigger reductions once rainfall surpasses a specific minimum intensity or duration.,2,Burst thresholds trigger cuts; operational logic signal.
Rain detections with no reduction in irrigation but later weather-based reductions suggest indirect influence of rainfall on weather models,"Rainfall may indirectly alter weather parameters later, causing reductions.",2,Indirect effect delayed via weather models; low privacy exposure.
Weather-based increases during periods of high rain detection variability indicate difficulty distinguishing between rain events and dry gaps,Frequent alternation between wet and dry signals prompts irrigation increases during short dry intervals.,2,Boosts amid variable rain show sensitivity to short dry gaps; operational trend.
Weather reductions continuing long after rain detections stop indicate extended moisture assumptions,The system assumes the environment remains wet for longer than rain duration alone would suggest.,2,Extended wetness assumption; operational tuning only.
Rain detections followed by weather-based increases suggest rainfall too weak to alter drying trends,"Light rain fails to stop dryness-driven irrigation boosts, so weather logic increases watering anyway.",2,Light rain insufficient; operational boost context.
