Weather-based reductions with soil moisture rising and no rain detections suggest high humidity or dew misinterpreted as rainfall,Environmental moisture sources raise soil moisture without true rainfall.,2,"Indicates possible false rain signals; low sensitivity."
Weather-based reductions with soil moisture falling and rain detections absent indicate flawed rainfall estimation,"The system reduces irrigation expecting rain, but moisture continues to fall.",3,"Shows incorrect rain estimation impacting moisture."
Weather-based increases alongside rain detections and rising soil moisture indicate overlapping irrigation and rainfall events,"The system irrigates despite rainfall, causing compounded moisture gain.",2,"Overlap of rain and irrigation; modest operational exposure."
Weather-based irrigation increases paired with rain detections and declining soil moisture indicate rapid environmental drying outpacing both irrigation and rain,Evapotranspiration or heat may be so strong that neither irrigation nor rainfall can maintain soil moisture.,3,"Highlights severe drying despite inputs; moderate sensitivity."
Stable soil moisture across alternating rain detections and weather adjustments indicates strong water buffering capacity,The soil holds sufficient water regardless of weather fluctuations.,1,"Shows buffering capacity; very low sensitivity."
Large soil moisture drops when weather-based reductions occur without rain detections indicate premature irrigation cutbacks,"The system reduces watering too early, causing rapid soil dryness.",3,"Premature cutbacks causing dryness; moderate operational sensitivity."
