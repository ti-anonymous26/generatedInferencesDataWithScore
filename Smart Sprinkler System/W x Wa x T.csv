Water usage rising during stable temperatures and stable humidity suggests irrigation decisions are schedule-driven,"Environmental factors remain unchanged, so irrigation increases must derive from internal schedules.",2,"Schedule-driven increase; low privacy risk."
Water usage falling during rising temperatures and falling humidity suggests irrigation misalignment with environmental stress,"Environmental drying increases, but irrigation fails to respond.",3,"Misalignment under drying stress."

Humidity spikes causing weather-based reductions combined with stable water usage suggest irrigation output is unresponsive to moisture-rich conditions,Humidity reduction logic is not influencing actual irrigation volume.,3,"Reduction commands not reflected in output."
Humidity drops causing weather-based increases paired with rising water usage indicate atmospheric drying is correctly detected,The system increases irrigation as moisture in the air decreases.,1,"Correct response to drying air; very low sensitivity."
Water usage rising dramatically during low humidity and low temperature suggests deep soil dryness rather than atmospheric-driven need,"Cool air reduces evaporation, so high usage likely compensates for soil conditions.",3,"Deep dryness despite favorable air; moderate concern."
Water usage falling during high temperature and high humidity suggests rainfall or dew not directly detected in weather logs,Moisture-rich conditions allow irrigation cycles to shrink even when temperatures rise.,1,"Unlogged moisture reducing use; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage falling rapidly after humidity spikes and weather-based reductions indicates natural hydration effects,Moisture-rich air or rainfall reduces the need for irrigation.,1,"Natural hydration lowering use; very low sensitivity."
Water usage rising despite humidity spikes and weather-based reductions indicates misconfiguration or persistent soil dryness,"The system reduces watering based on humidity, but dryness still requires high irrigation.",3,"Humidity logic ineffective against dryness."
Weather-based increases during falling humidity and stable temperatures with rising water usage suggest humidity-centric irrigation control,Dry air influences irrigation decisions more than temperature signals.,2,"Humidity-weighted control; low privacy risk."
Weather-based reductions during rising humidity and stable temperature with falling water usage indicate efficient irrigation conservation,"The system responds correctly to atmospheric moisture, reducing output.",1,"Efficient conservation with humidity; minimal sensitivity."
Water usage remaining high during weather-based reductions and low temperatures indicates schedule rigidity,Irrigation timing is fixed regardless of environmental factors.,3,"Rigid scheduling keeps use high."
Water usage remaining low during weather-based increases and high temperatures indicates under-watering risk,The system identifies drying conditions but water output does not increase accordingly.,3,"Under-watering despite dry signals."
Water usage rising at night during low temperatures despite weather-based reductions suggests misaligned watering schedules,"Nighttime cooling normally reduces irrigation need, but system configuration overrides environmental logic.",3,"Misaligned night watering; moderate operational concern."
Water usage dropping at night during high humidity and weather-based reductions reflects optimal conservation behavior,Environmental moisture and system logic reduce water output effectively.,1,"Optimal night conservation; very low sensitivity."
Water usage rising sharply during midday temperature peaks while weather logs show irrigation increases indicates diurnal demand matching,Irrigation scales correctly with peak daytime dryness.,2,"Daytime dryness response; low privacy risk."
Water usage falling sharply during morning humidity peaks despite weather increases suggests condensation or dew providing moisture,Environmental moisture inputs reduce irrigation demand unexpectedly.,1,"Dew/condensation reduces need; minimal sensitivity."
Stable water usage during volatile temperature and humidity conditions indicates irrigation insensitivity to environmental fluctuations,The system may be configured with fixed watering amounts or durations.,2,"Insensitive configuration; low privacy impact."
Large water usage variability during stable temperature and humidity suggests irrigation driven by weather forecast data rather than current conditions,System behavior depends on predicted conditions instead of real-time environmental data.,2,"Forecast-driven variability; low sensitivity."
Weather-based increases with minimal water usage rise during humidity drops indicate irrigation throttling or low-capacity mode,The system wants to irrigate more but physical delivery does not scale accordingly.,3,"Delivery constrained despite increase commands."
Weather-based reductions with water usage rising during humidity increases indicate competing control systems,One system reduces irrigation due to humidity while another increases it due to soil or schedule triggers.,3,"Competing controls causing conflicting outputs."
